      "text": "Ken, this is Peter. What led to the resolution? Well, we've had this dispute for about 10 years with IQVIA, and things were a lot different 10 years ago. IQVIA was still IMS, by the way, and just joining with IQVIA and Veeva wasn't that strong in clinical and IQVIA had a CRM product, and now they don't. So many things have changed, and we just got together sort of at the start of the year, some of the IQVIA leadership and myself and realized there's no reason for this conflict anymore.\r\nWe can begin to learn about each other and partner for the benefit of customers in Veeva and IQVIA. So it's just a passage of time, things changed, and we woke up and said, what are we fighting about? There's no reason to be doing this anymore. So I'm super happy, and I believe I can represent that IQVIA is very happy as well to have it resolved. Now in terms of what does it unlock for us, historically, in the commercial area, there was two barriers, two sort of artificial barriers.\r\nOne was with Salesforce. That was because of our OEM agreement, we were -- just we couldn't develop the applications we wanted. We weren't allowed, and we couldn't develop it in the way we wanted them either. So now that's gone with Salesforce since we've moved to Vault, and we have 100 live customers in CRM. That's really an anchor tenant in commercial. And then we had these important products, we have Veeva Network, Veeva Nitro, our commercial analytics offerings, and we couldn't put IQVIA data in there, so this was sort of a hole in our boat. These products were impractical because they couldn't put the industry-leading data in there. That's resolved now. So you got the Salesforce thing resolved, the IQVIA restrictions resolved. So I'm really looking forward to making Commercial Cloud sort of like Development Cloud, really no limits. Very excited about that. The biggest news in commercial for a long time."

So we're pleased with the $35 million raise there to full year guidance, which is roughly in line with the revenue increase. Quarterly billings, as we've spoken a bit about in the past, they're lumpy because there are a lot of timing factors. There's customer-specific items, operational things, mix on pre- and postpaid. And so it's just not a metric we use internally or a great indicator of the business, so annual is a better way to look at it, and we're really happy with the guide there."

Is there a larger role for Veeva to play and maybe extending that both into the lab and also manufacturing? And then looking ahead, is that maybe more of an outsized driver? Obviously, I appreciate it's broad-based, but is quality maybe factoring more into the 5-year plan than you thought perhaps a year ago?"

It is a big area, and it has gotten an elevated focus inside of Veeva in the last couple of years. The start of that was to go after the LIMS area, the Laboratory Information Management. That's a super important area. So -- and then we have batch release. We have a validation management product. So we really elevated that to the level of the full cloud because that can be a very big business for us, quality."

I guess how do you see the opportunity? I think it's interesting that Commercial Cloud takes on basically the look of Development Cloud in terms of Veeva controlling its full destiny now.\r\nDo you think that starts to be a meaningful incremental driver just monetizing agents into next year? Or do you actually think the bigger consequences maybe more strategic, in that Vault has developed such a robust architecture and partner ecosystem that Veeva is going to be a central role for the industry as they adopt AI, maybe regardless of whether it's a Veeva agent or not, Vault is going to be a part of that mix one way or the other?"

      "text": "Let's see. How I would think of it, you asked a few questions there. Let me reframe a little. The basic way I would think about it, Veeva Vault platform, we started that in 2010, actually, late 2010. It was around this -- it had content and it had data, and it could do both. And that was very unique and users work with content and data. And so we were able to make integrated suites in clinical and quality and regulatory and safety. And that's what we've been doing for the last 15 years and working very hard at it and making these deep industry applications, the business rules around all the data and the content.\r\nNow this is the next phase where we're going to have agents. We have -- we still have our data. We have our content, we have our agents and the users are going to interact with all the three and the agents also interact with the content and the data. So it's a fundamental new thing. And what we -- we've led really and are leading in this industry cloud area, industry-specific cloud applications.\r\nI think we're going to lead in industry-specific agents and certainly inside life sciences. So that's the way to think about it. The monetization will come from selling Veeva AI, which is two things: the platform, so customers can create their own custom agents, but mainly our industry-specific agents that they'll get when they buy Veeva AI.\r\nAnd with the model -- MCP, model context protocol, it's -- agent-to-agent interoperability is really easy and also Vault-to-Vault interoperability. We will -- in terms of monetizing that, we will create billions of dollars of value for the industry, no doubt about that. No doubt about that. Sometimes making humans much more efficient, sometimes reducing the need for certain people doing certain types of tasks. So there's tremendous amount of value will be captured by the industry, and we'll get our fair share of that for sure.\r\nBut we're going to take that slow, work with our early adopters sort of end of this year and '26 or so. I don't expect any material revenue contribution for '26 or '27, for example, but I expect it's a significant increase in our market size, and that will play out over many years. But this is going to be a tremendous benefit for Veeva, our employees who are building all these agents and our customers who are getting the value. So we're very excited about it. We've done that hard work over the last 7 months or so of plumbing it deeply into the Vault platform. That's the really hard work. And now the application agent work is really starting in earnest."

Specifically, would love to get your thoughts on, one, what's been the initial customer reaction feedback to the news just last week here? Do you have any? And then two, how should we think about IQVIA that historically has been a CRM competitor as we're going back to the Cegedim days, sold some of the CRM business to Salesforce? And how is that CRM-specific relationship with IQVIA changed?"

    {
      "componentOrder": 14,
      "speakerName": "Peter Gassner",
      "speakerType": "Executives",
      "text": "Okay. So customer reaction to Veeva and IQVIA has just been overwhelmingly positive because it's such good news for customers. If you're a life sciences company, especially a medium to large one, there's a few things you have to have. You have to have SAP for sure, in the supply chain. You have to have Microsoft on your desktop for sure. You have to have that. You're going to have Veeva inside your organization in 1 part, 2 parts, 5 parts, many parts. And you're going to have IQVIA as well, specifically the IQVIA data. That's what you're going to have.\r\nAnd what they had before was a problem, and they needed a lot of Band-Aids because in a lot of situations, IQVIA and Veeva didn't fit well together. So it's just a sense of relief from customers and exploring, \"hey, what's possible? Can I do this? Can I do that?\" So very, very positive. In terms of IQVIA, they were a historical competitor in CRM. They're not anymore.\r\nWhen Salesforce got into that market of directly pharmaceutical CRM and said they were going to build a product. IQVIA went out of that market, and I don't know what was the timing of what decisions there. I just know that IQVIA is not selling that CRM product anymore. So there's no issues there. We still compete with IQVIA in areas of things like reference data, our OpenData product, our Compass product, things like that. But that's okay. That's normal healthy competition. We partner in many, many areas, and we compete in some and customers benefit and they don't need so many Band-Aids anymore to stitch things together between Veeva and IQVIA."

Maybe, Peter, going back to the idea around the opportunity with AI, how you're kind of thinking about Veeva's platform approach, the network you've built, the scale you've built, giving you kind of that right to win as you embed more AI functionality across the platform? And maybe how more of these top 20 enterprises are going all in, maybe how that can serve as kind of gravity supporting some of that AI momentum with embedded intelligence and things of the like in the future?"

    {
      "componentOrder": 19,
      "speakerName": "Peter Gassner",
      "speakerType": "Executives",
      "text": "Yes. The right to win, we refer to that as structural advantage. When you have an application that's a system of record, be it the e-mail system or the supply chain system or all the 50 sort of applications that Veeva has that are deep in life sciences from the CRM system to the drug safety system to the clinical trial management system.\r\nWhen you have that system of record with the users in there, you have the right to win the deep industry-specific agents because it's in the user's workflow. Think about it, if you use Google for your e-mail and your calendar, you would love an agent from Google that works seamlessly with that if you could get it.\r\nSo we have a right to win there. You call it the right to win, I call it a structural advantage. We can knit that technology together so that it's a seamless platform that handles the agents, the content, the data. Another thing that Veeva has is we have a platform that's broad. We make about 50 applications with our platform. So we can touch a lot of things with our Vault platform. We put it in the Vault platform once and it can extend area everywhere. So we have a structural advantage. I think it's early for customers to be going all in on AI with Veeva because we haven't even released any agents yet. So we got to work with our first early adopters and work that out. We have to execute.\r\nThat's -- everybody has a grand plan, but do you execute on it? That's what really makes a difference. So we have to execute, prove our value. And over time, I'm quite confident when customers see the value, they will come, and they will want to go all in with Veeva for AI around the things that we do. And with Microsoft around other things that they do and with SAP around other things that they do. The nice thing about agentic AI that's framing up is these agents will be able to talk to each other in a much easier way than was possible before AI."

Maybe, Paul, for you, with the 2 top 20 customers live on CRM, I know there's been a handful of more momentum of others coming online over the past few months. Wondering how kind of the evidence of that live and successful implementation is resonating with customers, maybe how that stacks up on a like-for-like cost basis versus some of the conviction and maybe again, the customer conviction and the fact that, that's only going to get more efficient over time, kind of compounding the obvious nature of maybe needing to migrate."

      "speakerType": "Executives",
      "text": "Yes. Dylan, thanks. So let me step back a little bit and just give you a little bit of a broader context. We called out 7 top 20s committed to Vault CRM in the prepared remarks. I can give you a little more context beyond that, including verbal commitments, we added 2 additional top 20s for a total of 9 top 20s committed to Vault CRM. So we're doing really well in the market, and part of it is the go-lives and the continued execution there. To be fair, we're also aware that Salesforce had 1 additional top 20 verbal commit for a total of 3. So just to give you the full picture, the latest is Veeva has 9 top 20 wins. Salesforce is at 3.\r\nAll of the wins that I talk about are not equal, and this gets to your question here. There's a very big difference between a Veeva win and a Salesforce win. So you asked about the 2 top 20s go live. Less than 2 years after they made an announcement, they're now live in major markets, and that just happened this quarter. So with Veeva, a win almost becomes a certainty, right? We have to work at it. I don't want to make it sound too easy, but it's -- these are 2 significant live and happy customers now in some of their major markets, and they're going to continue to go live globally through the end of the year and beyond.\r\nSo that's where we are with wins. That's a huge milestone that has a big impact. With Salesforce, that's obviously very different. The earliest that they'll have a go-live with the top 20 in a single region is the end of 2026, possibly finishing in, let's say, the 2029 time frame. That's obviously a very long time. A lot of things can happen between now and then, especially as our customers get the benefit of all the things that Peter just talked about around Veeva AI being able to get started with AI this year.\r\nOur partnership with IQVIA, that they can take advantage of today, but that will get better over time. So the chance that all 3 Salesforce customers go live in all regions is actually low. It's just not proven. It's going to require a lot of custom work. It's going to take years to mature if it even gets there. So all of those 3 wins that they have, they're not equal to a Veeva win, and they all have a contingency plan, which is Veeva. So that's where things play out. The 2 wins that we had that are now live customers, obviously critically important.\r\nAnd these are multifactor decisions, but these are -- this is a pretty significant play in kind of how customers are thinking about where they place their chips. Beyond the top 20, that story even gets stronger, right, as smaller companies, they just can't afford to take a risk on a risky project. So we're feeling good about the competitive position, and this is a huge milestone that Veeva had, and I have confidence we'll be able to continue to win and continue to convert to live happy customers."

We do commercial and medical things and quality and manufacturing. So each one is different. In the commercial area, I don't think it's about reducing the number of people too much inside of life sciences, if at all, but it's enabling them to be more productive and hold more relationships and get more work done.\r\nAnd so that's very valuable in itself. If you look at areas within safety and clinical, there are some areas where there's a lot of outsourced -- hundreds of millions of dollars of outsourced labor who used to do processing type things. I think agentic AI can maybe remove the need for half of that. If you look at a clinical trial master file, agentic AI is going to be pretty good at putting a document where it should go and telling you if you have all the documentation you need for that trial based on the protocol. And is any document blurry? Is any document eligible, et cetera? It's going to be really darn good at that stuff.\r\nSo it will be different by each area, but agentic AI is going to do things -- some of the things that humans can do, agentic AI is going to be able to do that. That either frees up more human time for humans to be more productive on what they need to do or reduces the need for humans. So it's going to apply to every area just like people apply to every area, but it's going to apply in different ways."

We're starting to talk to early customers and getting that feedback, et cetera. So I think we'll have a project or two starting this year. And then we'll give more of an update on our Analyst Day, more of a fulsome update.\r\nBut if you think about Veeva, what do we do? We make excellent products. We really buckle down and make excellent products. We sort of avoid the hype and all that stuff, and we improve those products with our customers, and we're very authentic. And maybe everybody thinks that, yes, you can't do that in horizontal software. Well, I don't know. I think we'll buck the trend, and I think we'll do that.\r\nSo in the horizontal software, I think you'll see the flavor and the culture of Veeva come through, and you'll see the product excellence come through. And you got to remember, a lot of these cloud applications, they were made before -- they were certainly made before AI, but a lot of them were made before the iPhone, too. So there are some structural things when we're starting from scratch here that we can really take advantage of and the whole new markets team is super excited about that. So more to come, but the activity is definitely going full steam."

It really helps our business consulting, too, which drives stickiness.\r\nI would say it lets customers over time take a bigger bite at the Veeva apple in commercial such -- yes and then you saw that in clinical. When our product suite got very mature and got fulsome and got practical for people, you started customers, \"hey, maybe I'll just get all that Veeva stuff at once.\" And I think that's going to happen a bit more in commercial. So it's transformative. I would say if you had to think about the benefit for Veeva, maybe 25% of that benefit is related to actually revenue there, business consulting and network and Nitro and 75% of it is related to the network and the network effect that will have on the broader commercial."

You've already launched a couple. So the question here is, what is the path to a doubling or maybe even 2.5x number of products in CRM look like? And are AI agents part of the count along that path?

But these other applications were somewhat stalled for two reasons. First, things like Campaign Manager, Service Center, Patient CRM, we couldn't develop them until we decided to move off of the Salesforce platform. That was about 3 years ago. So we had to develop those.\r\nAnd then for the ones that dealt with data and analytics, those were stymied due to the IQVIA restrictions. So long story short, we have the product footprint we need to really increase our revenue in commercial, and now we just have to mature those products and do that hard work of customer adoption and customer success.

So that has all the people that deal with clinical and all the data about clinical and all the business rules and all the content and all the security about clinical trials. So with Veeva AI, when we build an application agent, that's built inside of the Vault platform.\r\nSo it inherently knows all the security rules and how to deal with that. And it's running in the Vault application server. So it also has transaction control. So it can update the data and the content. It can act on behalf of the user inside of a workflow in a transactionally sound way. So that's a structural advantage if you have the application. So for example, and what I said is if you're using Google for mail and if you need an agent to help you write e-mails, boy, Google has an inside advantage on that one because they know what you're doing in the e-mail.\r\nSo that's the main thing. And then from the technology perspective, we have some good technologists here making good decisions. One of the nice things is we waited a little bit to help the large language models, tell the base AI technology settled down a little bit, so we could be really accurate on how to do things. And when we put it into the Vault Platform, we took a platform-first approach. So it's going to have very wide adoption across our different applications. Now you asked about something like agent force. Agent force really grew out of the use case of a call center agent, your 1-800 number and you need -- you used to outsource those people now use Agent force. That's a little bit different. What we're doing is more of a deep application. And there are other toolkit-based approaches that says, \"Hey, you can build a bunch of AI with our toolkit. We're not like that. We are deeply embedded in the application, which I think is a structural advantage and makes it very sticky."

That's -- I think that's going to be one of the unheralded -- people don't realize how much of a benefit that is when you have agents that can talk to agents across systems because they're all following a common protocol, much less brittle than you're wiring things up with a mule soft and transferring data back and forth. I'm really excited about that potential. And it can expose from system-to-system communication, but also for a user.\r\nI might be in my Microsoft Office, and I might say, \"File this document in TMF.\" Well, the Microsoft Office copilot may have that agent, the TMF filing agent from Veeva registered with it. So it says, \"Any of the agents know how to do this? The TMF agent would say, I sure do.\" Okay. I'll hand the document over to you and the way it goes. And that might have been just from within a person's e-mail and they just said, \"Hey, file is documented in the TMF.\" Well, the agent would know by reading that document, well, what clinical site are you talking about? And what type of a form is this? And what investigators is related to, and I have to fill out 3 or 4 fields, okay, I got it from the definition of this particular trial, and I'll fish that out of the PDF, Okay.

But we have about 300 more to go. So this is going to become a machine. \r\nNow I think what it will do, and you're right, some customers are hesitant to migrate to Vault CRM, but the main reason is they're happy with Veeva CRM. It's working for them, and they have other things to focus on. Now I think the pull of AI in CRM will cause a little bit of a pull as it really starts to roll out. That will cause a bit of pull. And then time marches on, right? When we get into '26, certainly the end of '27, most customers are going to think, well, I'm not going to ride Veeva CRM, wait until the end. I got to get going. I got to get this done. \r\nSo we always thought the bulk of our migrations would happen in 2026 and 2027, and I still think that's true.

In fact, when -- sometimes when we have strategic meetings with the customer, I was thinking about a meeting we had a few weeks ago with the CEO and his management team of a medium-sized pharma company. I think the biggest eye opener was actually what our business consulting can do for their company. Because for the first time in the industry, you have a business consulting group that can do business process transformation that is aligned with the technology partner as well. \r\nSo these are reinforcing things. Now when AI comes in here, every AI project is a business consulting project because you're changing the boundaries of what the humans do and what the agents do, and that's not going to happen just by sending an e-mail. It's not going to work like that. So you're right, it's a major structural advantage. I guess if we would disclose how many specific business consulting AI projects we're starting in any one quarter, that would be a leading indicator. We don't break it down that way, but it's certainly something I watch because that's the start of an AI project. \r\nWe have one going on right now, an early adopter that wanted to get going even far before the software was ready and it started with a business consulting project in the commercial content area, which is a very intricate workflow of handoffs of people between medical, regulatory and legal and different brands in different countries, very intricate. So when an agent is going to do some of that, you have to figure out, well, what is my workflow and what is my expectation for that. And while if those people were doing that step and they're not going to be doing that step anymore, what work do I want them to do. So that's all business consulting. Like I said, that's not just send an e-mail, use the agent. That's not going to work."

But mainly it's significant is we'll show up with a more wholesome -- a more fulsome solution to the customer. It will enable us to do all types of things, make new data products, make new analytical products, and just show up with a better, more full suite. \r\nSo I couldn't be more excited about it. And then I think the main reason I'm excited is customers are excited about it, our joint customers, we had -- I guess, just the week after it was announced, the following week, I believe, or maybe 1 week afterwards, we had a call -- a joint call with Veeva and IQVIA with -- I believe that was certainly a top 20 pharma, if not a top 10 at their request, and there was high-level people from the customer. And that never happened before as far as I know in sort of the history of Veeva here. \r\nAnd it was very productive information sharing. The Veeva team came away energized. The IQVIA team came away energized and the customer team came away energized and there was actually specific follow-ups to explore this or to explore that. That never happened before. So I'm just optimistic that a lot of value can be created and ideas can come out of this that are super positive for the industry. We do different things, IQVIA and Veeva, and then we compete in certain areas. But the one thing we do share deeply, both of us, proven, deep commitment and understanding of the industry. IQVIA is a much bigger company than us, and they do different things than us. But we share that in space. We're both deeply committed to the industry. \r\nWe're probably the 2 largest companies that are deeply, deeply committed to -- in terms of revenue anyway or impact, deeply committed to life sciences. And now we're working together in the customers' interest. I'm pretty excited about it."

And you've outlined a measured approach to releasing AI agents into the market. So wondering if you could comment on how you plan to work with partners in the interim as you get to a fuller set of agents released -- and any early thoughts on where Veeva can automate in a differentiated way versus partnerships effectively driving value for your life science sponsor clients?"

I guess that's true, but the goals are pretty big. So when we talk about in the TMF area, where we have 20 out of the top 20 using our TMF, we have a goal internally about to see if we can reduce the processing and the outsourced labor needed in and around the TMF by 50% in the industry. And that's not measured. That's a very, very aggressive goal. \r\nSo to do that, you got to start out with these big goals in mind and then you got to incrementally make progress. Partners will play a part in that because with Veeva AI and the ability to develop these agents and for agents to interoperate, I think there's going to be good room for partners to develop agents that interoperate with our agents and then customers to develop their own custom agents pretty quickly to do the small things that we're not going to get around to that might be very specific to that customer. So measured progress and very deliberate platform first, but the goals are very large."

You mentioned back then that could be lumpy, and that was reflected in the full year guide. \r\nSo I guess just one quarter later, I just want to confirm how you're still thinking about that lumpiness for the back half of fiscal '26. And then also for fiscal 1Q, you mentioned Crossix was growing at over 30%.

  "text": "# Veeva Systems Inc. - Q2 2026 Earnings Call\nDate: 2025-08-27T21:00:00Z\nType: Earnings Calls\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. My name is Abby, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Veeva Systems Fiscal 2026 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Gunnar Hansen of Veeva IR. You may begin.\n\n## Gunnar Hansen (Executives)\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Veeva's Fiscal 2026 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for the quarter ended July 31, 2025. As a reminder, we posted prepared remarks on Veeva's Investor Relations website just after 1:00 p.m. Pacific today. We hope you have had a chance to read them before the call. Today's call will be used primarily for Q&A. With me today for Q&A are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, EVP, Strategy; and Brian Van Wagener, our Chief Financial Officer.\r\nDuring this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business, including guidance regarding future financial results. These forward-looking statements will be based on our current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially.\r\nPlease refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, August 27, 2025, based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We may discuss our guidance on today's call, but we will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum.\r\nOn the call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release and in the supplemental investor presentation, both of which are available on our website.\r\nWith that, thank you for joining us, and I'll turn the call over to Peter.\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nThank you, Gunnar, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We had another strong quarter, delivering Q2 results ahead of our guidance. Total revenue in the quarter was $789 million with non-GAAP operating income of $353 million. Thanks to the team and our customers, our industry cloud vision is starting to come together. That means great industry-specific software, data and business consulting, all working together to help the industry become more efficient and effective. I'm especially excited about the clear vision and rapid progress on Veeva AI that will be transformative for Veeva and the industry over time. We'll now open up the call to your questions.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ken Wong with Oppenheimer.\n\n## Hoi-Fung Wong (Analysts)\nFantastic. Peter, I wanted to touch on the resolution in terms of lawsuit with IQVIA. Can you help us walk through kind of what led to that resolution and what potential opportunities this could potentially unlock? And then for Brian, just on the billings guide, a nice increase there, although with an in-line 2Q. Just help us understand the confidence in increasing the back half with what was a more in line-ish second quarter?\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nKen, this is Peter. What led to the resolution? Well, we've had this dispute for about 10 years with IQVIA, and things were a lot different 10 years ago. IQVIA was still IMS, by the way, and just joining with IQVIA and Veeva wasn't that strong in clinical and IQVIA had a CRM product, and now they don't. So many things have changed, and we just got together sort of at the start of the year, some of the IQVIA leadership and myself and realized there's no reason for this conflict anymore.\r\nWe can begin to learn about each other and partner for the benefit of customers in Veeva and IQVIA. So it's just a passage of time, things changed, and we woke up and said, what are we fighting about? There's no reason to be doing this anymore. So I'm super happy, and I believe I can represent that IQVIA is very happy as well to have it resolved. Now in terms of what does it unlock for us, historically, in the commercial area, there was two barriers, two sort of artificial barriers.\r\nOne was with Salesforce. That was because of our OEM agreement, we were -- just we couldn't develop the applications we wanted. We weren't allowed, and we couldn't develop it in the way we wanted them either. So now that's gone with Salesforce since we've moved to Vault, and we have 100 live customers in CRM. That's really an anchor tenant in commercial. And then we had these important products, we have Veeva Network, Veeva Nitro, our commercial analytics offerings, and we couldn't put IQVIA data in there, so this was sort of a hole in our boat. These products were impractical because they couldn't put the industry-leading data in there. That's resolved now. So you got the Salesforce thing resolved, the IQVIA restrictions resolved. So I'm really looking forward to making Commercial Cloud sort of like Development Cloud, really no limits. Very excited about that. The biggest news in commercial for a long time.\n\n## Brian Van Wagener (Executives)\nAnd Ken, this is Brian. I'll pick up the second question on billings. So on billings, really annual is the better indicator. So we're pleased with the $35 million raise there to full year guidance, which is roughly in line with the revenue increase. Quarterly billings, as we've spoken a bit about in the past, they're lumpy because there are a lot of timing factors. There's customer-specific items, operational things, mix on pre- and postpaid. And so it's just not a metric we use internally or a great indicator of the business, so annual is a better way to look at it, and we're really happy with the guide there.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird.\n\n## Joseph Vruwink (Analysts)\nGreat. Nice to see R&D subscriptions and services with larger upside just relative to how we've been modeling it. I've been interested in the evolution of Quality Cloud. It seems like that's receiving an elevated stature inside Veeva. I was hoping you can maybe just speak what you're seeing. Is there a larger role for Veeva to play and maybe extending that both into the lab and also manufacturing? And then looking ahead, is that maybe more of an outsized driver? Obviously, I appreciate it's broad-based, but is quality maybe factoring more into the 5-year plan than you thought perhaps a year ago?\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nI'll take that one. This is Peter. For the last one, I think we're very happy with our 5-year plan, we have a lot of confidence in our $6 billion revenue plan. And the changes in quality from what we see are not material. It's on track for where we roughly thought it would be. It is a big area, and it has gotten an elevated focus inside of Veeva in the last couple of years. The start of that was to go after the LIMS area, the Laboratory Information Management. That's a super important area. So -- and then we have batch release. We have a validation management product. So we really elevated that to the level of the full cloud because that can be a very big business for us, quality.\n\n## Joseph Vruwink (Analysts)\nOkay. That's great. And then just on the excitement around AI, the first products focused more in the commercial suite and then broadening out there into next year. I guess how do you see the opportunity? I think it's interesting that Commercial Cloud takes on basically the look of Development Cloud in terms of Veeva controlling its full destiny now.\r\nDo you think that starts to be a meaningful incremental driver just monetizing agents into next year? Or do you actually think the bigger consequences maybe more strategic, in that Vault has developed such a robust architecture and partner ecosystem that Veeva is going to be a central role for the industry as they adopt AI, maybe regardless of whether it's a Veeva agent or not, Vault is going to be a part of that mix one way or the other?\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nLet's see. How I would think of it, you asked a few questions there. Let me reframe a little. The basic way I would think about it, Veeva Vault platform, we started that in 2010, actually, late 2010. It was around this -- it had content and it had data, and it could do both. And that was very unique and users work with content and data. And so we were able to make integrated suites in clinical and quality and regulatory and safety. And that's what we've been doing for the last 15 years and working very hard at it and making these deep industry applications, the business rules around all the data and the content.\r\nNow this is the next phase where we're going to have agents. We have -- we still have our data. We have our content, we have our agents and the users are going to interact with all the three and the agents also interact with the content and the data. So it's a fundamental new thing. And what we -- we've led really and are leading in this industry cloud area, industry-specific cloud applications.\r\nI think we're going to lead in industry-specific agents and certainly inside life sciences. So that's the way to think about it. The monetization will come from selling Veeva AI, which is two things: the platform, so customers can create their own custom agents, but mainly our industry-specific agents that they'll get when they buy Veeva AI.\r\nAnd with the model -- MCP, model context protocol, it's -- agent-to-agent interoperability is really easy and also Vault-to-Vault interoperability. We will -- in terms of monetizing that, we will create billions of dollars of value for the industry, no doubt about that. No doubt about that. Sometimes making humans much more efficient, sometimes reducing the need for certain people doing certain types of tasks. So there's tremendous amount of value will be captured by the industry, and we'll get our fair share of that for sure.\r\nBut we're going to take that slow, work with our early adopters sort of end of this year and '26 or so. I don't expect any material revenue contribution for '26 or '27, for example, but I expect it's a significant increase in our market size, and that will play out over many years. But this is going to be a tremendous benefit for Veeva, our employees who are building all these agents and our customers who are getting the value. So we're very excited about it. We've done that hard work over the last 7 months or so of plumbing it deeply into the Vault platform. That's the really hard work. And now the application agent work is really starting in earnest.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.\n\n## Brent Bracelin (Analysts)\nI guess first one for Peter here. I'd like to go back to the long-standing dispute with IMS and IQVIA that you settled. Specifically, would love to get your thoughts on, one, what's been the initial customer reaction feedback to the news just last week here? Do you have any? And then two, how should we think about IQVIA that historically has been a CRM competitor as we're going back to the Cegedim days, sold some of the CRM business to Salesforce? And how is that CRM-specific relationship with IQVIA changed?\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nOkay. So customer reaction to Veeva and IQVIA has just been overwhelmingly positive because it's such good news for customers. If you're a life sciences company, especially a medium to large one, there's a few things you have to have. You have to have SAP for sure, in the supply chain. You have to have Microsoft on your desktop for sure. You have to have that. You're going to have Veeva inside your organization in 1 part, 2 parts, 5 parts, many parts. And you're going to have IQVIA as well, specifically the IQVIA data. That's what you're going to have.\r\nAnd what they had before was a problem, and they needed a lot of Band-Aids because in a lot of situations, IQVIA and Veeva didn't fit well together. So it's just a sense of relief from customers and exploring, \"hey, what's possible? Can I do this? Can I do that?\" So very, very positive. In terms of IQVIA, they were a historical competitor in CRM. They're not anymore.\r\nWhen Salesforce got into that market of directly pharmaceutical CRM and said they were going to build a product. IQVIA went out of that market, and I don't know what was the timing of what decisions there. I just know that IQVIA is not selling that CRM product anymore. So there's no issues there. We still compete with IQVIA in areas of things like reference data, our OpenData product, our Compass product, things like that. But that's okay. That's normal healthy competition. We partner in many, many areas, and we compete in some and customers benefit and they don't need so many Band-Aids anymore to stitch things together between Veeva and IQVIA.\n\n## Brent Bracelin (Analysts)\nHelpful color there. And then, Brian, just a quick follow-up on that R&D subscription growth. Sequentially, it looks like it rose the most in 2 years. What drove the momentum in my side in R&D this quarter?\n\n## Brian Van Wagener (Executives)\nYes, so it continues to again be broad-based. We're really pleased with the execution of this team across all areas, and they're working in a pretty stable environment. So I think you saw a really strong Q2 and things firming up as we go into the second half of the year and Q3 and Q4, broad-based strong execution.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd our next question comes from Dylan Becker with William Blair.\n\n## Dylan Becker (Analysts)\nAppreciate it here. Nice job. Maybe, Peter, going back to the idea around the opportunity with AI, how you're kind of thinking about Veeva's platform approach, the network you've built, the scale you've built, giving you kind of that right to win as you embed more AI functionality across the platform? And maybe how more of these top 20 enterprises are going all in, maybe how that can serve as kind of gravity supporting some of that AI momentum with embedded intelligence and things of the like in the future?\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nYes. The right to win, we refer to that as structural advantage. When you have an application that's a system of record, be it the e-mail system or the supply chain system or all the 50 sort of applications that Veeva has that are deep in life sciences from the CRM system to the drug safety system to the clinical trial management system.\r\nWhen you have that system of record with the users in there, you have the right to win the deep industry-specific agents because it's in the user's workflow. Think about it, if you use Google for your e-mail and your calendar, you would love an agent from Google that works seamlessly with that if you could get it.\r\nSo we have a right to win there. You call it the right to win, I call it a structural advantage. We can knit that technology together so that it's a seamless platform that handles the agents, the content, the data. Another thing that Veeva has is we have a platform that's broad. We make about 50 applications with our platform. So we can touch a lot of things with our Vault platform. We put it in the Vault platform once and it can extend area everywhere. So we have a structural advantage. I think it's early for customers to be going all in on AI with Veeva because we haven't even released any agents yet. So we got to work with our first early adopters and work that out. We have to execute.\r\nThat's -- everybody has a grand plan, but do you execute on it? That's what really makes a difference. So we have to execute, prove our value. And over time, I'm quite confident when customers see the value, they will come, and they will want to go all in with Veeva for AI around the things that we do. And with Microsoft around other things that they do and with SAP around other things that they do. The nice thing about agentic AI that's framing up is these agents will be able to talk to each other in a much easier way than was possible before AI.\n\n## Dylan Becker (Analysts)\nThat's very helpful. And that does make sense. Maybe, Paul, for you, with the 2 top 20 customers live on CRM, I know there's been a handful of more momentum of others coming online over the past few months. Wondering how kind of the evidence of that live and successful implementation is resonating with customers, maybe how that stacks up on a like-for-like cost basis versus some of the conviction and maybe again, the customer conviction and the fact that, that's only going to get more efficient over time, kind of compounding the obvious nature of maybe needing to migrate.\n\n## Paul Shawah (Executives)\nYes. Dylan, thanks. So let me step back a little bit and just give you a little bit of a broader context. We called out 7 top 20s committed to Vault CRM in the prepared remarks. I can give you a little more context beyond that, including verbal commitments, we added 2 additional top 20s for a total of 9 top 20s committed to Vault CRM. So we're doing really well in the market, and part of it is the go-lives and the continued execution there. To be fair, we're also aware that Salesforce had 1 additional top 20 verbal commit for a total of 3. So just to give you the full picture, the latest is Veeva has 9 top 20 wins. Salesforce is at 3.\r\nAll of the wins that I talk about are not equal, and this gets to your question here. There's a very big difference between a Veeva win and a Salesforce win. So you asked about the 2 top 20s go live. Less than 2 years after they made an announcement, they're now live in major markets, and that just happened this quarter. So with Veeva, a win almost becomes a certainty, right? We have to work at it. I don't want to make it sound too easy, but it's -- these are 2 significant live and happy customers now in some of their major markets, and they're going to continue to go live globally through the end of the year and beyond.\r\nSo that's where we are with wins. That's a huge milestone that has a big impact. With Salesforce, that's obviously very different. The earliest that they'll have a go-live with the top 20 in a single region is the end of 2026, possibly finishing in, let's say, the 2029 time frame. That's obviously a very long time. A lot of things can happen between now and then, especially as our customers get the benefit of all the things that Peter just talked about around Veeva AI being able to get started with AI this year.\r\nOur partnership with IQVIA, that they can take advantage of today, but that will get better over time. So the chance that all 3 Salesforce customers go live in all regions is actually low. It's just not proven. It's going to require a lot of custom work. It's going to take years to mature if it even gets there. So all of those 3 wins that they have, they're not equal to a Veeva win, and they all have a contingency plan, which is Veeva. So that's where things play out. The 2 wins that we had that are now live customers, obviously critically important.\r\nAnd these are multifactor decisions, but these are -- this is a pretty significant play in kind of how customers are thinking about where they place their chips. Beyond the top 20, that story even gets stronger, right, as smaller companies, they just can't afford to take a risk on a risky project. So we're feeling good about the competitive position, and this is a huge milestone that Veeva had, and I have confidence we'll be able to continue to win and continue to convert to live happy customers.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd our next question comes from Brian Peterson with Raymond James.\n\n## Brian Peterson (Analysts)\nCongrats on the quarter. So I just wanted to take a step back and think about the agentic opportunity. And if you think about how we could maybe size that or where you could see some of the early opportunities? I think in commercial, we see that. But if we're looking at the R&D portfolio and what Vault could be with agentic opportunities, what are some of the early use cases you'd see there? And how would you kind of look at that opportunity thinking about maybe commercial versus R&D?\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nI'll take that one. It's certainly different, right? That's -- we have a lot of variety in Veeva, right? We do clinical trial operations. We do commercial and medical things and quality and manufacturing. So each one is different. In the commercial area, I don't think it's about reducing the number of people too much inside of life sciences, if at all, but it's enabling them to be more productive and hold more relationships and get more work done.\r\nAnd so that's very valuable in itself. If you look at areas within safety and clinical, there are some areas where there's a lot of outsourced -- hundreds of millions of dollars of outsourced labor who used to do processing type things. I think agentic AI can maybe remove the need for half of that. If you look at a clinical trial master file, agentic AI is going to be pretty good at putting a document where it should go and telling you if you have all the documentation you need for that trial based on the protocol. And is any document blurry? Is any document eligible, et cetera? It's going to be really darn good at that stuff.\r\nSo it will be different by each area, but agentic AI is going to do things -- some of the things that humans can do, agentic AI is going to be able to do that. That either frees up more human time for humans to be more productive on what they need to do or reduces the need for humans. So it's going to apply to every area just like people apply to every area, but it's going to apply in different ways.\n\n## Brian Peterson (Analysts)\nAnd maybe a follow-up. I'd love to get an update on some of your horizontal software ambitions. I know that was a big theme at the Analyst Day last year. Any progress to date that you can share?\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nYes. No specific progress. I think just to reiterate, we're working on a platform-first approach here. Our first -- and we're making great progress. We know we have a good team, pretty stable team, making excellent progress, really excited about it. We have said in the CRM area will be our first use case, our first application. We're starting to talk to early customers and getting that feedback, et cetera. So I think we'll have a project or two starting this year. And then we'll give more of an update on our Analyst Day, more of a fulsome update.\r\nBut if you think about Veeva, what do we do? We make excellent products. We really buckle down and make excellent products. We sort of avoid the hype and all that stuff, and we improve those products with our customers, and we're very authentic. And maybe everybody thinks that, yes, you can't do that in horizontal software. Well, I don't know. I think we'll buck the trend, and I think we'll do that.\r\nSo in the horizontal software, I think you'll see the flavor and the culture of Veeva come through, and you'll see the product excellence come through. And you got to remember, a lot of these cloud applications, they were made before -- they were certainly made before AI, but a lot of them were made before the iPhone, too. So there are some structural things when we're starting from scratch here that we can really take advantage of and the whole new markets team is super excited about that. So more to come, but the activity is definitely going full steam.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Stan Berenshteyn with Wells Fargo Securities.\n\n## Stanislav Berenshteyn (Analysts)\nFirst one, Peter, for you. Going back to IQVIA news, just with Nitro and Network getting a second life here, can you just size the dollar opportunity for these products? And what kind of uptake should we anticipate from clients?\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nIn terms of the dollar opportunity, I would say similar to some of our other add-on products, maybe a bit bigger, but similar. But the way to think about it is what it enables for our full commercial suite. So this helps our CRM products and all the different products we have, our events management, our patient, CRM, our campaign management, our data products because it's a more full solution. It really helps our business consulting, too, which drives stickiness.\r\nI would say it lets customers over time take a bigger bite at the Veeva apple in commercial such -- yes and then you saw that in clinical. When our product suite got very mature and got fulsome and got practical for people, you started customers, \"hey, maybe I'll just get all that Veeva stuff at once.\" And I think that's going to happen a bit more in commercial. So it's transformative. I would say if you had to think about the benefit for Veeva, maybe 25% of that benefit is related to actually revenue there, business consulting and network and Nitro and 75% of it is related to the network and the network effect that will have on the broader commercial.\n\n## Stanislav Berenshteyn (Analysts)\nGot it. And then a follow-up for Brian. On the Commercial Cloud subscriptions, they were, I believe, kind of flattish quarter-on-quarter here. And in the prepared remarks, Crossix was called out as seeing continued strength and momentum here in the quarter. So first, wondering if there's anything offsetting that momentum here in the fiscal 2Q? And then what is factored into the raised guidance for commercial subscriptions?\n\n## Brian Van Wagener (Executives)\nStan, so yes, great quarter for Crossix in Q2 on the back of a few great quarters in a row now. So we're really pleased with the execution of that team. We expect that to continue to be a meaningful driver of growth in commercial going forward and in the balance of the year. And then I think more broadly, you see the growth, as we touched on earlier in the call, in R&D subscriptions, which also picking up in the second half and seeing firming up of the pipeline in the second half. So good quarter of execution in Q2 and a solid view going into the second half of the year here.\n\n## Stanislav Berenshteyn (Analysts)\nI guess if you could just comment why was the quarter like flattish sequentially, if there's any offsets there? And what drove the raised guidance for the back half of the year for Commercial Cloud?\n\n## Brian Van Wagener (Executives)\nWell, on commercial, I think similar factors to what we've spoken about previously, Stan. So that we still see Crossix being the main driver there. We saw that in the past quarter, continues to be a driver in Q2.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies.\n\n## David Windley (Analysts)\nManagement has talked about, I think, CRM evolving to a breadth of products that would rival what R&D looks like today with the kind of release or the transition over to Vault and away from Salesforce reliance and now your IQV resolution that you talked about today, Peter, that seems to kind of open the path to do that more aggressively. You've already launched a couple. So the question here is, what is the path to a doubling or maybe even 2.5x number of products in CRM look like? And are AI agents part of the count along that path? Or do you think of those as companion to that path?\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nExcellent question. I think there may be some new applications, but that's probably not the main way I look at it. I look at it for Veeva AI will expand our opportunity. Also, we have now opportunity to pull through some of the newer applications we already have, Campaign Manager, Service Center, Patient CRM, Network, Nitro, some of our data products and our commercial analytics.\r\nSo if you look at our revenue on the commercial side now, Crossix doing quite well, commercial content doing quite well and the core CRM doing quite well. But these other applications were somewhat stalled for two reasons. First, things like Campaign Manager, Service Center, Patient CRM, we couldn't develop them until we decided to move off of the Salesforce platform. That was about 3 years ago. So we had to develop those.\r\nAnd then for the ones that dealt with data and analytics, those were stymied due to the IQVIA restrictions. So long story short, we have the product footprint we need to really increase our revenue in commercial, and now we just have to mature those products and do that hard work of customer adoption and customer success. But we're free in commercial. The runway is clear. We just have to do that hard work to go down that path.\n\n## David Windley (Analysts)\nExcellent. And then the follow-up for me would be just to confirm and clarify that in your data products and development path that you're thinking about there, your agreement with IQVIA does not restrict you in any way from pursuing the development, the applications that you want to, the data that you want to.\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nRight. There's no restriction on Veeva. There's no restriction on IQVIA, where the market is open and free, and so we'll compete in some areas, partner in some areas. And we both have an interest in customer success, but no restrictions on Veeva.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd our next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi.\n\n## Tyler Radke (Analysts)\nPeter, on the IQVIA partnership, I know a lot of questions have been asked on that. But is there sort of immediate imminent kind of revenue unlocks that is perhaps driving the higher forecast for this year around some of the data products? If you could just hit on like what this year this unlocks, if anything?\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nYes, nothing material for this year. Nothing that -- our confidence in the year is just that Q3 and Q4 are closer now than they were 90 days ago and things are firming up. So no, it's -- any additional revenue was unlocked as it relates to IQVIA, not material for this year, but it will contribute in the coming years.\n\n## Tyler Radke (Analysts)\nOkay. Great. And then more of a product and technology question, but you talked a lot about your optimism, maybe a bit more medium to long term around AI and agents. Could you just sort of articulate what you view as the unique differentiator from an architecture perspective of Vault versus agent force or even the back end of IQVIA? Like what do you think is -- puts you at an advantage whether certain design or technology decision that you made?\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nYes. Our main advantage is we have the deep applications. So if we just take a clinical example, again, we have the clinical trial management application. So that has all the people that deal with clinical and all the data about clinical and all the business rules and all the content and all the security about clinical trials. So with Veeva AI, when we build an application agent, that's built inside of the Vault platform.\r\nSo it inherently knows all the security rules and how to deal with that. And it's running in the Vault application server. So it also has transaction control. So it can update the data and the content. It can act on behalf of the user inside of a workflow in a transactionally sound way. So that's a structural advantage if you have the application. So for example, and what I said is if you're using Google for mail and if you need an agent to help you write e-mails, boy, Google has an inside advantage on that one because they know what you're doing in the e-mail.\r\nSo that's the main thing. And then from the technology perspective, we have some good technologists here making good decisions. One of the nice things is we waited a little bit to help the large language models, tell the base AI technology settled down a little bit, so we could be really accurate on how to do things. And when we put it into the Vault Platform, we took a platform-first approach. So it's going to have very wide adoption across our different applications. Now you asked about something like agent force. Agent force really grew out of the use case of a call center agent, your 1-800 number and you need -- you used to outsource those people now use Agent force. That's a little bit different. What we're doing is more of a deep application. And there are other toolkit-based approaches that says, \"Hey, you can build a bunch of AI with our toolkit. We're not like that. We are deeply embedded in the application, which I think is a structural advantage and makes it very sticky.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC.\n\n## Rishi Jaluria (Analysts)\nWonderful. Nice to see continued progress here. Maybe I want to ask 2 questions on the AI front, which I know has been dominating this call. Number one, Peter, you talked about the ability to leverage MCP and agent-to-agent transactions. \r\nI just want to kind of understand, are you going to be architecting your agents out in a way/have you already started to see this where it's not only living within the Vault ecosystem or the Veeva ecosystem, but you have the ability to do agent-to-agent transactions outside of Veeva, whether that's with completely different vendors like a Workday or ServiceNow or even something that might be a little bit coopetition like an agent force from Salesforce or something from IQVIA. And then I've got a quick follow-up.\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nYes. Certainly, we're architecting it that way that if you have an agent inside of Veeva, it can talk to an agent that might be inside of SAP or Workday or a different Salesforce One and vice versa. That's -- I think that's going to be one of the unheralded -- people don't realize how much of a benefit that is when you have agents that can talk to agents across systems because they're all following a common protocol, much less brittle than you're wiring things up with a mule soft and transferring data back and forth. I'm really excited about that potential. And it can expose from system-to-system communication, but also for a user.\r\nI might be in my Microsoft Office, and I might say, \"File this document in TMF.\" Well, the Microsoft Office copilot may have that agent, the TMF filing agent from Veeva registered with it. So it says, \"Any of the agents know how to do this? The TMF agent would say, I sure do.\" Okay. I'll hand the document over to you and the way it goes. And that might have been just from within a person's e-mail and they just said, \"Hey, file is documented in the TMF.\" Well, the agent would know by reading that document, well, what clinical site are you talking about? And what type of a form is this? And what investigators is related to, and I have to fill out 3 or 4 fields, okay, I got it from the definition of this particular trial, and I'll fish that out of the PDF, Okay. I got that, and I'm done there.\" So that can't happen without agentic behavior.\n\n## Rishi Jaluria (Analysts)\nAll right. Got it. That's really helpful. And then maybe just sticking with AI agents. One of the -- in our checks, one of the kind of things that have led to some customers dragging their feet on migrations to Vault CRM have been rebuilding some of the customizations that they've done with the previous Veeva CRM. Is there an opportunity that you can leverage your agents to make that transition and movement of applications easier?\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nNo,   I would say no, it wouldn't help the migration easier. Now what's really helped there is we've really got our tooling really well refined. That's not AI-based tooling. That's very specific migration tooling. And we have our services team, our partners teams trained up because we have a lot of projects underway now. I think we've migrated over 20 customers. But we have about 300 more to go. So this is going to become a machine. \r\nNow I think what it will do, and you're right, some customers are hesitant to migrate to Vault CRM, but the main reason is they're happy with Veeva CRM. It's working for them, and they have other things to focus on. Now I think the pull of AI in CRM will cause a little bit of a pull as it really starts to roll out. That will cause a bit of pull. And then time marches on, right? When we get into '26, certainly the end of '27, most customers are going to think, well, I'm not going to ride Veeva CRM, wait until the end. I got to get going. I got to get this done. \r\nSo we always thought the bulk of our migrations would happen in 2026 and 2027, and I still think that's true. We have to see how it plays out, but I got to believe more than 2/3 are going to be done in '26 and '27.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd our next question comes from Ryan MacDonald with Needham.\n\n## Ryan MacDonald (Analysts)\nCongrats on a great quarter. Peter, I was fascinated about the comments on the use of Veeva Business Consulting to sort of help push forward your AI initiatives, particularly because we obviously hear plenty about sort of agent fatigue amongst buyers and organizations just broadly these days. \r\nCan you just talk about sort of what level of sort of demand that you're seeing from customers for some of these consulting services to help with change management? And moving forward, should we sort of look at projects from business consulting as sort of a leading indicator for Agentic AI adoption of your Veeva AI tools?\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nAgentic fatigue? I love that term. Did you make it yourself? Or is that an industry term I don't know about?\n\n## Ryan MacDonald (Analysts)\nI don't think I'm that clever, so I'll say it's the industry.\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nOkay. Well, I don't know. Maybe I got it or maybe I don't agentic fatigue, but that's a good term. You're right to pick up on this. In fact, when -- sometimes when we have strategic meetings with the customer, I was thinking about a meeting we had a few weeks ago with the CEO and his management team of a medium-sized pharma company. I think the biggest eye opener was actually what our business consulting can do for their company. Because for the first time in the industry, you have a business consulting group that can do business process transformation that is aligned with the technology partner as well. \r\nSo these are reinforcing things. Now when AI comes in here, every AI project is a business consulting project because you're changing the boundaries of what the humans do and what the agents do, and that's not going to happen just by sending an e-mail. It's not going to work like that. So you're right, it's a major structural advantage. I guess if we would disclose how many specific business consulting AI projects we're starting in any one quarter, that would be a leading indicator. We don't break it down that way, but it's certainly something I watch because that's the start of an AI project. \r\nWe have one going on right now, an early adopter that wanted to get going even far before the software was ready and it started with a business consulting project in the commercial content area, which is a very intricate workflow of handoffs of people between medical, regulatory and legal and different brands in different countries, very intricate. So when an agent is going to do some of that, you have to figure out, well, what is my workflow and what is my expectation for that. And while if those people were doing that step and they're not going to be doing that step anymore, what work do I want them to do. So that's all business consulting. Like I said, that's not just send an e-mail, use the agent. That's not going to work.\n\n## Ryan MacDonald (Analysts)\nYes, makes sense. I appreciate all the color there. Maybe as a follow-up, it's great to see some of the continued progress with the Compass product suite. But you did call out Compass prescribers seeing a bit of resistance in the marketplace or resistance to change. Can you just talk about maybe what's driving that resistance, whether it's sort of macro driven? Is there sort of incremental product investments you need to make there? Just any color you can provide on that.\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nI would say there's always incremental product investments we need to do and sometimes you run the race and you run 100 miles an hour, and that's faster than you expected. And sometimes you run 50 miles an hour, and that's a little slower than you expected. This one is probably a little slower than expected. We ran into a few more bumps than we expected. I think in prescriber, particularly, we probably underestimated the -- just the resistance to change in that area. But it's -- we're turning the corner a bit, but really customers are pretty happy with it. \r\nWe project -- this is the first product to project procedures -- products and procedures for 4,000-plus brands. And that was just not available before. So people don't know really what to make of it too much. They're very used to the way things are. So it's just been a hard market. But when it goes, it will go, I think.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\n[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.\n\n## Craig Hettenbach (Analysts)\nGreat. Just a question on the macro backdrop, which hasn't changed for the prepared remarks kind of in the last 90 days. Crossix is highlighted as an area of relative strength. Any other kind of segments that you would call out in terms of despite some of the macro uncertainty that are still performing really well?\n\n## Brian Van Wagener (Executives)\nCraig, yes, this is Brian. I'll take this one. On the macro environment, I think what we're seeing overall is while there's still elevated uncertainty, there's really no change. It's fairly stable in that level of uncertainty. So we continue to see customers work effectively within that environment. We continue to see pipeline build and deals progress. And that's the main contributor to what you heard us talk about as a firming up of the view for Q3 and Q4. No one area that I would call out in particular, we're seeing good execution across the business and customers stay focused on the task at hand.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\n\n## William McNamara (Analysts)\nThis is Bill on for Kirk. Brian, you already have great margins, but are you seeing any in-house benefits yet from AI and R&D or sales and marketing functions?\n\n## Brian Van Wagener (Executives)\nBill, so I think on AI internally, we don't expect a meaningful contribution from that in the short term. We think these have the potential to be a transformational tool over the long term. But for us, it's really a new tool about driving productivity and quality. And so we've got access that everybody internally has with some models that are integrated with our e-mail system. \r\nOur engineers have specific tools that are in their flow of work, a lot like what Peter talked about with customers and building AI embedded in customers' flow of work. But I wouldn't expect a big sudden headcount change. It's a tool that we're using to continue to drive quality and productivity in our team.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd our next question comes from DJ Hynes with Canaccord Genuity.\n\n## David Hynes (Analysts)\nSo going back to the 2 top 20s that have gone live on Vault CRM in major markets, -- can you just speak to the economics of those very early large Vault CRM customers, both spend levels and margin contribution maybe compared to what that may have looked like on legacy Veeva CRM?\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nI guess, again, I can take that one. Price is similar, I guess, the best way you say it. It's not exactly the same because the packaging is somewhat different. It's a bit simplified in Vault CRM versus Veeva CRM. But revenue-wise to Veeva about similar. \r\nOver the long term, our cost of goods sold will be about -- will be smaller. In the short term, actually a little bit bigger because we have some transition costs. So during that transition time, the customers, we're getting them going on Vault CRM and the customers are still using the Veeva CRM and they continue that for a while to do a cutover and archive. So in the short term, a little more cost of goods sold and then in the longer term, better cost of goods sold. But from a revenue perspective, should be roughly neutral.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd our next question comes from Jailendra Singh with Truist Securities.\n\n## Jailendra Singh (Analysts)\nI wanted to follow up on the Crossix comments. Can you be a little bit more specific there? It seems remain strong. But how would trend there compared to Q1? And broadly, what would you attribute some of the key drivers behind Crossix' performance? Is it strength in industry trends? Or are you gaining market share? Just trying to better understand if all the noise around other marketing channels for pharma companies is creating more opportunity for you guys and your confidence in sustainability of those trends going forward?\n\n## Brian Van Wagener (Executives)\nJailendra, this is Brian. I'll take this one. On the Crossix trends, I think we saw continued strong performance coming into Q2. You'll recall that in Q1 where we had some outperformance there, we said it was largely driven by audiences, and we're waiting to see some of those trends play out. We saw continued growth across the Crossix business. \r\nWe're not going to break it out specifically, but continues to be a meaningful driver of growth in commercial, and we see that continuing as we go into the balance of the year. There's some seasonality in Crossix. It tends to be a little bit heavier in Q1 and over the course of the year, but that's really more about the nature of the market than any change in the macro trends. And we think we're positioned well there and continuing to pursue market leadership in that space.\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nYes. I would add on, I would say we are increasing market share is one thing we're doing. And then we are increasing our product footprint. So audience is relatively new for us. That's growing quite well. And then traditionally, Crossix made was very strong in the consumer measurement and optimization of the patients, the potential patients. Now we're getting quite a bit better and pharma is actually spending more incremental money in the marketing to health care providers. \r\nAnd so we're doing more measurement in what's called HCP marketing. So that's what you're seeing. It's growth on 2 axes, both market share and product footprint. And then that's really -- if you get down to it, that's driven by producing solid ROI and customer success. It's kind of a word-of-mouth business, and that's what's going on.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd our next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays.\n\n## Saket Kalia (Analysts)\nOkay. Great. Peter, maybe for you, it's great to get to see the IQVIA stuff sort of behind us. Nitro, in my view, was really one of Veeva's early AI products. And we didn't hear much about that product earlier on because of the data challenges with IQVIA. But now that, that's out of the way, how quickly can we get Nitro back in front of customers? And how much of a multiplier could that be to your CRM deals or however you think about the revenue opportunity?\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nYes. It is. if you're happy to see it, I'm probably tly happy to see it. And the whole Veeva team, imagine if you're working on the Nitro product or the network product, you're going in there and you have one hand tied behind your back. Now all of a sudden, you don't have that restriction. So part of it is we have to learn that motion in Veeva, right? \r\nWe have to invest in the people and invest in the product and the selling. We have to relearn that motion. So that -- it's not going to happen overnight. We need to do that. And in terms of the revenue, again, I won't break it out, but it will be significant. But mainly it's significant is we'll show up with a more wholesome -- a more fulsome solution to the customer. It will enable us to do all types of things, make new data products, make new analytical products, and just show up with a better, more full suite. \r\nSo I couldn't be more excited about it. And then I think the main reason I'm excited is customers are excited about it, our joint customers, we had -- I guess, just the week after it was announced, the following week, I believe, or maybe 1 week afterwards, we had a call -- a joint call with Veeva and IQVIA with -- I believe that was certainly a top 20 pharma, if not a top 10 at their request, and there was high-level people from the customer. And that never happened before as far as I know in sort of the history of Veeva here. \r\nAnd it was very productive information sharing. The Veeva team came away energized. The IQVIA team came away energized and the customer team came away energized and there was actually specific follow-ups to explore this or to explore that. That never happened before. So I'm just optimistic that a lot of value can be created and ideas can come out of this that are super positive for the industry. We do different things, IQVIA and Veeva, and then we compete in certain areas. But the one thing we do share deeply, both of us, proven, deep commitment and understanding of the industry. IQVIA is a much bigger company than us, and they do different things than us. But we share that in space. We're both deeply committed to the industry. \r\nWe're probably the 2 largest companies that are deeply, deeply committed to -- in terms of revenue anyway or impact, deeply committed to life sciences. And now we're working together in the customers' interest. I'm pretty excited about it.\n\n## Saket Kalia (Analysts)\nSounds like a great outcome for everybody.\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nYes, it is. .\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nOur next question comes from Jeff Garro with Stephens.\n\n## Jeffrey Garro (Analysts)\nI'll throw one more AI question out there, specifically around the R&D product set. The market seems to have a strong appetite for AI in clinical development. And you've outlined a measured approach to releasing AI agents into the market. So wondering if you could comment on how you plan to work with partners in the interim as you get to a fuller set of agents released -- and any early thoughts on where Veeva can automate in a differentiated way versus partnerships effectively driving value for your life science sponsor clients?\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nWell, the partner work certainly continues, and we have customers using partners, and there's no issues there. You mentioned a measured approach about AI. I guess that's true, but the goals are pretty big. So when we talk about in the TMF area, where we have 20 out of the top 20 using our TMF, we have a goal internally about to see if we can reduce the processing and the outsourced labor needed in and around the TMF by 50% in the industry. And that's not measured. That's a very, very aggressive goal. \r\nSo to do that, you got to start out with these big goals in mind and then you got to incrementally make progress. Partners will play a part in that because with Veeva AI and the ability to develop these agents and for agents to interoperate, I think there's going to be good room for partners to develop agents that interoperate with our agents and then customers to develop their own custom agents pretty quickly to do the small things that we're not going to get around to that might be very specific to that customer. So measured progress and very deliberate platform first, but the goals are very large.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Mizuho Securities.\n\n## Steven Valiquette (Analysts)\nYes. So really, just a quick follow-up, another one here on Crossix, which I think you kind of half answered, but I'm just going to ask it anyway. So last quarter in fiscal 1Q, you mentioned the usage-based component of Crossix drove more of the upside. You mentioned back then that could be lumpy, and that was reflected in the full year guide. \r\nSo I guess just one quarter later, I just want to confirm how you're still thinking about that lumpiness for the back half of fiscal '26. And then also for fiscal 1Q, you mentioned Crossix was growing at over 30%. So I'm just wondering, are you able to comment on whether Crossix is still -- or was still comping at 30% growth or more in the fiscal second quarter as well?\n\n## Brian Van Wagener (Executives)\nWe continue to see good growth in both areas of Crossix, the measurement business, which is a little more consistent subscription-like business as well as the audiences business, which is usage-based. -- both were drivers of growth in Q2. Audiences was in Q1 and remains in Q2, the higher growth segment of the business, the smaller but higher growth segment of the business. We're not going to break down the specific growth rate quarter-by-quarter and speak to the 30% each quarter, but it still remains the audiences as the primary growth driver of that business.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Andrew DeGasperi with BNP Paribas.\n\n## Andrew DeGasperi (Analysts)\nJust on a follow-up, I appreciate the color on the verbal commitments on the CRM side. I was just wondering, are you seeing any -- can you comment on any potential verbal commitments on EDC? And if you can't answer that question, I was just going to add in terms of the headcount growth you had, I know it's the recent graduate class. I'm just wondering, is this like a once-a-year event because I didn't see that kind of level of additions in the past 12 months atleast.\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nYes, I'll take the verbal commitment one. We're always talking with customers on EDC and other areas, but we don't -- we really don't get into that level of verbal commitment. I think the Salesforce one is a little bit of a sort of a weird territory we're in here with the Veeva CRM for the next 9 months. So we wanted to give you an update there because we know people are interested in that one. And then, Brian, in terms of the seasonality, do you want to take that one?\n\n## Brian Van Wagener (Executives)\nYes, absolutely. So on the hiring side, the headline there is it's in line with our expectations and driven by the core business. Generation Veeva, which is our hiring program for recent graduates was, as you mentioned, the largest driver of that. That's a really important program for us. It feeds our consulting, our professional services and our engineering. It had a larger class in Q2 relative to its usual mix, but was in line with our expectation. So a little bit of a shift in the mix versus prior years, but as we expected.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd our next question comes from David Larsen with BTIG.\n\n## David Larsen (Analysts)\nHow many total Vault CRM wins were there in the quarter? I think there were 28 last quarter. And just any color on the trends sequentially and where those wins are coming from, please?\n\n## Paul Shawah (Executives)\nYes, David, this is Paul. We had 13 total, which was a mix of new customers that were mostly buying a first CRM, but also of some of the migrations from Veeva CRM. So I would think about each quarter having a mix of both of those categories, but also it being relatively lumpy because the number of companies that are coming online each quarter buying a new CRM, that will vary. That will be -- that will change. It's not a linear thing. And then also the number of migrations in 2025, I expect that to be some of the lower years. I expect that number to ramp up as we get into 2026 and through '27 and even 2028.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Peter Gassner for closing remarks.\n\n## Peter Gassner (Executives)\nThank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and thank you to our customers for your continued partnership and to the Veeva team for your outstanding work in the quarter. I'm looking forward to talking with you again at our upcoming Investor Day, October 16. Thankyou.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\n",

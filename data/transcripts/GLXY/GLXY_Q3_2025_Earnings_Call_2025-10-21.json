It's great to have the chance to connect directly with all of you and share a little bit more about what we're working on here at Galaxy.\r\nI'm joined by Mike Novogratz, Galaxy's Founder and CEO; Tony Paquette, Galaxy's CFO; and Zac Prince, Head of GalaxyOne. We're going to try and answer as many questions as we can today. There are some that we will not be able to answer. As per usual, we won't be addressing nonpublic financials or other information, anything that is inappropriate or irrelevant and questions on specific crypto assets or new products, among others. If you'd like to submit a question, feel free to tweet it us or raise your hand to speak on the spaces.\r\nLastly, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer provided in the spaces post and note that none of the information in the spaces constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities.\r\nWith that, let's get started.

And I'll try to be a little less dry than Jonathan, but that's his role. He's our dry man with all the disclaimers and facts.\r\nListen, if you heard our earnings call this morning, we had a great quarter. We just had a management committee meeting here, and everyone's eyes are spinning because we're so busy. There is a tremendous amount happening in the digital asset space right now. Opportunities, our clients are looking to do things. TradFi are looking to do things. And so we are at the hunt for talent. We're looking at lots of opportunities. And so I couldn't be more excited. Excited to answer your questions today. Glad we have Zac on to talk a little bit about GalaxyOne, if you have questions there. And if you don't, I'll ask them some questions. And so let's get to it.\r\nI will throw to Jonathan to pick the first question, anyone has the courage to raise their hand or their virtual hand."

      "text": "First of all, congrats on the results. It's pretty amazing to see that the past 8 years have brought us here. I've got a few questions. My first one will be regarding VC holdings. We've been wondering for a while in our small group of DD club, whether or not the company was going to reevaluate the current holdings to market conditions. We've been waiting for this for a few years. I remember Alex Ioffe back in the day saying that his interpretation of the market was that the holdings in the VC sphere were going to be higher. And in the same way, I was wondering if a lower discount would be applicable to the L3 assets we've got on the sheet. We've heard on the call that bullish was upgraded to L1 type and so I guess my question regarding the other assets is pretty much the same."

      "text": "Yes, listen, so we have a pricing committee that meets monthly. And certainly quarterly before we put them out, they go through each asset on our balance sheet and they market -- I'd like to think conservatively, but they market what they think is a fair mark. Those marks are just for liquidity or illiquidity. Something like bullish was held on the balance sheet at a certain mark and then it goes public. And now it's liquid security. And so it trades at a -- it gets marked where the stock price goes.\r\nWhen you look at the entire thing, I like turning illiquid into liquid over time. And so we're constantly looking to do that where we have illiquidity, create more liquidity. Usually, that's after the life cycle of an asset. Crypto is interesting. Some of these things have been on our balance sheet for 10, 12 years, right? We've got a lot of Ripple equity. We were day 1 investors in Ripple even before Galaxy. It was just a family office. That has actually slowly moved up. They do tender offers every 6 months.\r\nWe tender in, we get some liquidity, and then we mark to some discount to that tender because we're not allowed to sell our entire thing. And so every quarter, you can see in our financials that illiquid thing moves around. Sometimes things get moved up, sometimes things get moved down. And I think it does a pretty good approximation of figuring out when you put in the illiquidity that sometimes works against you and sometimes works for you, right?\r\nThere are a lot of venture stuff that you know are going to be worth more than they're marked at one day or even now, but that's where the mark is because there's no activity in that specific name. And so I know it's an imperfect science, but it's taken very seriously. Tony Paquette runs that process. And that's -- it's quite frankly, the best we can do and it's best any company like ours does do."

And then, of course, there's a 20% carry in most of those funds on top of any profits. And so -- and that carry -- some of that gets paid out to the team and some stays with the house, with the investors.\r\nWe -- I don't want to jump the shark here to understand if we published exactly by fund. But I think roughly 20% to 30% is where we've been in most of these funds. We were less than that in the very first interactive fund, which was the EOS fund originally, we were like 10%. But in most of the funds since then, we've been 20% to 30%."

I was wondering where you see GK8 sitting at in this market? And where do you see custody as a service, but mostly as a fee clipping like when you got smart contract settlement and maybe also AllUnity. So I'd like to see if there's a moat regarding GK8 and if at any moment you see GK8 having its own fierce moment, if I may."

      "text": "Yes. Listen, the tokenization process itself is not so complicated, right? I think where you're going to see the value over time is connecting the entire infrastructure process, which is like capital raising in some ways, right, figuring out what assets should be tokenized or can be tokenized, and how to distribute those and then where those distributed assets sit in custody. It's kind of a complex web.\r\nGK is an important part of our infrastructure plan as well as our staking business, right? GK8 has built our tokenization engine, and they've been a key part of the AllUnity plan. But we're all still relatively early in this. We're hoping to announce some partnerships very soon with traditional TradFi players, where we're partnering in those infrastructure pieces. And so we're both going to do our own infrastructure and then a lot of partnerships around that.\r\nNobody is really tokenizing at scale right now. And some of that, I think, will change in the next 18 months. I think once you get clarity from the bill that hopefully gets passed in Washington in the next few months, the market structure bill. Once you also get understanding of where these tokenized security assets will trade, right now, they need to trade on ATSs and there are not a lot of big liquid pools around ATSs. And so all the pieces aren't in place yet for the tokenization world to really explode, but we're really close. And I think we're going to be making a lot of pivots and investments along the next few months to make sure that we're part of that future."

      "text": "Now my question, first one is with regards to something you said on the Empire podcast. You alluded to how the data center business, even though it's so prominently stated, I think the quote you used is, \"It's merely 10% of your time of your brain power.\" I was wondering if you could perhaps talk us through from an investor standpoint, what are sort of the other 90% of what's on your brain and really, in doing so, also stress the risks that are most pertinent to you when you manage this business together with Tony, what is it you allocate your brain power to? What are the risks you're most actively managing?"

      "speakerName": "Michael Novogratz",

      "text": "Sure. It's a fair question. Let me state by the first premise is that I couldn't only spend 10% of my brain power on the data center if Chris Ferraro wasn't spending 40% to 50% of his, right? Chris is a beast. And he was perfectly suited for a business like this because he's got a structured finance background. He understands how to get financing as does Tony. And this stuff is you better be reading the contracts. And I'm not a real contract reader, and Chris goes through with a fine-tooth comb these 400-page leases. And so we got the right guy at Galaxy of managing that process.\r\nListen, the crypto business is a lot more complicated in terms of the decisions one needs to make about where this industry is going. Like we all say tokenization is going to happen, but how and when and where is the liquidity going to be? What exchanges are they going to trade on. And so part of this is looking at the chessboard and trying to make the right decisions. I spent a lot of my time thinking about what talent we need and how to recruit that talent, right?\r\nOur best assets go up and down the elevator every day, right? This is a human capital business. And not only recruiting talent, but getting them to work together to a common goal is a big part of a lot of my brainpower. I spent a decent amount of my time telling the Galaxy story. A lot of you guys on Twitter gave me a wrath of s*** for years for not talking about Galaxy enough.\r\nAnd we heard you loud and clear. Some of that was because we were a Canadian company that was stuck in a 5-year listing process in the U.S. And when you're in that process, you're not allowed to speak about your company because that's called pumping the well or priming the well. And so I had kind of a gag order, but now we don't. And we want to make sure people understand the value of our company and the story of our company to bring in liquidity, right?\r\nWhat you realize is stock price is pretty correlated with volume and liquidity. And so great that we had over 4,000 people on our Twitter earnings call -- on our YouTube earnings call today. That's way up from when we were 9 months ago. And so that's part of the job. And then I oversee the liquid risk here. I'm 30-year macro veteran. Crypto at its core is macro, right?\r\nWhat's driving the big moves in Bitcoin and the other coins and the other ecosystems is a story about dollar debasement. And so I spent a decent amount of my time in my old networks, talking to the macro traders, understanding like the geopolitics of the world and the market environment of the world so we can make the right decisions around our balance sheet. And so when you put it all together, it's a full-time job, I promise."

      "text": "Yes. Listen, the whole world is complicated right now, right? We've got a really polarized country. And so the politics of our country have never been worse and that creates nervousness and uncertainty. We have what feels to most people like we're in some stage of a bubble around data centers and AI. And what I've said over and over is bubbles happen around things that fundamentally change the way we live. If it was the railroad bubble or the Internet bubble, right, like the railroads really did change the way we live, just like the Internet did.\r\nAI will do so as well, which means prices will get way higher than probably the reality will be over a long period of time. Nobody knows if we're in the middle third quarter or fourth quarter of this frenzy. But so we're trying to manage -- how do you manage that risk as best you can, knowing that at one point in the next few years, you'll have a pretty sizable washout, right?\r\nAll this CapEx that's being spent isn't all going to make money. Some of it will make a ton of money and some of it won't. And so how do you hedge and how do you prepare for that inevitable. And again, I don't know if the inevitable is in 3 months or 3 years. And I don't think anyone else does either, but there will be an inevitable pullback because there's just too much capital being spent and not all of it is going to be productive."

Well, if it can prove itself that it's growing revenue, it's going to be an amazing -- have an amazing ability and flip to profitability, an amazing ability to borrow money to meet those obligations. And if it can, it won't.\r\nLike right now, it seems like it can raise equity at ever higher valuations and almost as much as it can, but that doesn't last forever. And so in lots of ways, OpenAI is the linchpin. And in some ways, it's too big to fail because our government really fundamentally believes, and I think this is not just the Trump administration. I think this is probably bipartisan that winning AI is existential for the long-term success of the United States, that rightfully or wrongfully, they see this as a cold war against China. And this is an arms race.\r\nI personally don't, but who cares what I think. I know the government does. And so I don't think either government, if the Democrats were in charge or the Republicans are going to let the U.S. lose the AI arms race. And so that -- you put all together, it's a complicated equation. And that has to be -- I spent a ton of time thinking about that risk, talking to smart people about that risk. And if you start seeing cracks, what does that mean for -- what are the moves Galaxy needs to make?"

And then each business leader is actually the one who's finally responsible for building out their teams. And so you can go to the website, galaxy-com-careers, and it lists all our job offerings.\r\nJust to give you some sense, our summer internship program last year that had 25 summer interns.

And will the grid be able to sustain this kind of power demand. And so in lots of ways, that responsibility is ERCOT's with their partners, right? WETT and AEP, which is the power provider that we use.\r\nAnd so for us, it's making sure that our applications have the best chance of being approved by them. And that is working with each of those bureaucracies to make sure they get the test results and the studies that they need to realize that we'll be able to pull the next 800 megawatts to 2.7 gigawatts of power and the grid will be able to withstand that.\r\nWhen the power goes into the box, and Chris Ferraro talked to this, this morning, right, that's where we're handing off the baton to CoreWeave, who has really developed a world-class, best-in-class ability to get the most out of the chips, the way they stack them, the way they connect them. And so we decided that was not going to be one of the domain expertise is at this point we focused on. It's why we partnered with CoreWeave.

When we get the next approval of more power, we're going to look really carefully, do we diversify away from CoreWeave to other tenants or not. And that will be a real, I think, healthy discussion. The reason you diversify is because having multiple tenants is always a good risk mitigant.\r\nAnd listen, we've been paid a whole lot to work with CoreWeave, and they've been great partners. And so we're certainly going to -- that can be the first conversation we have. And as time passes, the technology is shifting quickly. And so we can already see that the first 200-megawatt Phase 1 that we're doing for CoreWeave, Phase 2 is going to look different. They're going to pack things tighter. They're going to get more usage out of the same amount of megawatts and same amount of space.\r\nAnd so I think each iteration will be a little different than the last one. And we're more of in the -- we're not driving that process. We're helping, but we're really -- we're riding along that process, working with our GC, our in-house people, but mostly with our tenants."

So thanks. In terms of expanding GalaxyOne outside of the U.S., we will absolutely be doing that. It's not something that is on our super short-term part of the road map. And the reason for that is a lot of the products that we're offering are kind of highly regulated financial services products. And our focus, at least to start is on the U.S. market, but we will absolutely be expanding into Canada.\r\nStill a little bit TBD in terms of what exactly that product mix will look like when we do expand, but we will get there. And I've heard a number of folks from Canada, parts of Europe and other places request access to some of the things that we're doing at GalaxyOne, and we hear you, and it is on the road map, but don't expect something there like in the next 6 months."

Do you think that DAT fee revenue will be a significant revenue source in the future? And how is the competitive landscape given some of the fees that Galaxy is charging for these services?"

And so that will keep our asset management business busy and profitable for a while. I pray those DATs grow because if those DATs grow, our assets under management grow. And some are growing. Tom Lee is doing a brilliant job at Bitminer of raising new equity and building his asset base every week, right?\r\nMichael Saylor did the best job and MicroStrategy has slowed down in its growth. And you're going to probably see feast or famine in these DATs. Some are going to be great businesses. Others are going to be what I will call closed-end funds with decent assets.\r\nI think the acceleration of DATs is going to slow, right? I think we're at the tail end of using DATs to raise capital for the crypto business. And I say that because the 3 biggest ecosystems, quite frankly, the 4 biggest ecosystems all have raised significant DATs. And so you don't need 15 Solana DATs or 15 Bitcoin DATs. And so now there's a place where public equity markers -- public equity investors can go to play with DATs space. They also have the ETF space. And so -- and crypto people still have normal crypto space. And you're going to see all these things converge over time. And so I think Tom is right that we had -- we probably hit peak DAT, but I don't think that means the revenue from those DATs goes away."

Listen, I think the most exciting thing that will happen next year for Galaxy is that by the middle of the year, Helios starts cash flowing. And that will just be cool because we know it's like you turn your hose on, it starts off coming slowly and then as you turn and turn, the water comes out faster and faster. That's the way to think of Helios.\r\nWe start cash flowing probably end of the first quarter and by the end of the year, it's really cash flowing. And 18 months after that, it's hundreds of millions of dollars per quarter. And that changes the dynamic of this place immensely. And so in some ways, we've got a year to keep grinding before the Helios cash flow machine turns on.\r\nEach year, we approach the crypto business relatively similarly. We approach it scared and optimistic, like scared that we know it's a very volatile space and that we've lived through a bunch of cycles and they can be painful, optimistic in that we're seeing so many new opportunities show up. We wouldn't be hiring people if we didn't think we're now at the precipice of really becoming part of the financial landscape of the world, right?\r\nCrypto was kind of a science project. For the first few years, we were running Galaxy, and now it's integrating with traditional finance at an accelerating pace. One of the metrics we look at is assets on platform, right? The more assets we have on platform, that's staking assets, asset management assets, assets in our lending book, those are recurring revenue things, and they give the company more and more ballast and so we don't have enough of that yet for me to sleep like a baby, maybe we never will because I don't sleep that much. But that's our goal as a firm is to continue to build those assets that are recurring revenue, knowing that this is going to stay a volatile space for a while. I hope that helps."

Are we on?\n\n## Jonathan Goldowsky (Executives)\nMike, we are on, and good morning, everyone. We're very excited to be hosting our Third X Spaces following our Q3 earnings print this morning. It's great to have the chance to connect directly with all of you and share a little bit more about what we're working on here at Galaxy.\r\nI'm joined by Mike Novogratz, Galaxy's Founder and CEO; Tony Paquette, Galaxy's CFO; and Zac Prince, Head of GalaxyOne. We're going to try and answer as many questions as we can today. There are some that we will not be able to answer. As per usual, we won't be addressing nonpublic financials or other information, anything that is inappropriate or irrelevant and questions on specific crypto assets or new products, among others. If you'd like to submit a question, feel free to tweet it us or raise your hand to speak on the spaces.\r\nLastly, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer provided in the spaces post and note that none of the information in the spaces constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities.\r\nWith that, let's get started. Mike, I'll pass it over to you for some quick remarks before we open this one up.\n\n## Michael Novogratz (Executives)\nYes, guys. First of all, apologies for the late start. We -- punctuality is important to my life, and I hate being late, and so sorry about that. We'll try not to happen again. And I'll try to be a little less dry than Jonathan, but that's his role. He's our dry man with all the disclaimers and facts.\r\nListen, if you heard our earnings call this morning, we had a great quarter. We just had a management committee meeting here, and everyone's eyes are spinning because we're so busy. There is a tremendous amount happening in the digital asset space right now. Opportunities, our clients are looking to do things. TradFi are looking to do things. And so we are at the hunt for talent. We're looking at lots of opportunities. And so I couldn't be more excited. Excited to answer your questions today. Glad we have Zac on to talk a little bit about GalaxyOne, if you have questions there. And if you don't, I'll ask them some questions. And so let's get to it.\r\nI will throw to Jonathan to pick the first question, anyone has the courage to raise their hand or their virtual hand.\n\n## Jonathan Goldowsky (Executives)\nAll right. Let's kick it off with Vinyle. Vinyle your line should be unmuted, over to you to ask a question.\n\n## Unknown Analyst (Analysts)\nAre you hearing me? Are you hearing me right now?\n\n## Jonathan Goldowsky (Executives)\nLoud and clear.\n\n## Unknown Analyst (Analysts)\nFirst of all, congrats on the results. It's pretty amazing to see that the past 8 years have brought us here. I've got a few questions. My first one will be regarding VC holdings. We've been wondering for a while in our small group of DD club, whether or not the company was going to reevaluate the current holdings to market conditions. We've been waiting for this for a few years. I remember Alex Ioffe back in the day saying that his interpretation of the market was that the holdings in the VC sphere were going to be higher. And in the same way, I was wondering if a lower discount would be applicable to the L3 assets we've got on the sheet. We've heard on the call that bullish was upgraded to L1 type and so I guess my question regarding the other assets is pretty much the same.\n\n## Michael Novogratz (Executives)\nYes, listen, so we have a pricing committee that meets monthly. And certainly quarterly before we put them out, they go through each asset on our balance sheet and they market -- I'd like to think conservatively, but they market what they think is a fair mark. Those marks are just for liquidity or illiquidity. Something like bullish was held on the balance sheet at a certain mark and then it goes public. And now it's liquid security. And so it trades at a -- it gets marked where the stock price goes.\r\nWhen you look at the entire thing, I like turning illiquid into liquid over time. And so we're constantly looking to do that where we have illiquidity, create more liquidity. Usually, that's after the life cycle of an asset. Crypto is interesting. Some of these things have been on our balance sheet for 10, 12 years, right? We've got a lot of Ripple equity. We were day 1 investors in Ripple even before Galaxy. It was just a family office. That has actually slowly moved up. They do tender offers every 6 months.\r\nWe tender in, we get some liquidity, and then we mark to some discount to that tender because we're not allowed to sell our entire thing. And so every quarter, you can see in our financials that illiquid thing moves around. Sometimes things get moved up, sometimes things get moved down. And I think it does a pretty good approximation of figuring out when you put in the illiquidity that sometimes works against you and sometimes works for you, right?\r\nThere are a lot of venture stuff that you know are going to be worth more than they're marked at one day or even now, but that's where the mark is because there's no activity in that specific name. And so I know it's an imperfect science, but it's taken very seriously. Tony Paquette runs that process. And that's -- it's quite frankly, the best we can do and it's best any company like ours does do.\n\n## Unknown Analyst (Analysts)\nYes, I appreciate the answer. I would have another question regarding VC, if it's authorized. I was wondering if you could walk us through the ownership structure regarding the funds we own. I'm talking about Galaxy Interactive, but more recently about the new fund. We heard you on some podcast saying that we were owning, as a company, 30% of that kind of business. I just want to make sure we understand well where we sit in every fund as per ownership.\n\n## Michael Novogratz (Executives)\nYes. So in each fund, Galaxy puts our own firm capital into the fund to help seed the fund. Depending on how much they raise, our percentage goes up or down. And then, of course, there's a 20% carry in most of those funds on top of any profits. And so -- and that carry -- some of that gets paid out to the team and some stays with the house, with the investors.\r\nWe -- I don't want to jump the shark here to understand if we published exactly by fund. But I think roughly 20% to 30% is where we've been in most of these funds. We were less than that in the very first interactive fund, which was the EOS fund originally, we were like 10%. But in most of the funds since then, we've been 20% to 30%.\n\n## Unknown Analyst (Analysts)\nAppreciate it. And if I may have a last question regarding tokenization?\n\n## Michael Novogratz (Executives)\nYes.\n\n## Unknown Analyst (Analysts)\nI was wondering because we heard that BlackRock was looking to build its own technology, and we see -- we can understand that most big banks might see a threat with tokenization. I was wondering where you see GK8 sitting at in this market? And where do you see custody as a service, but mostly as a fee clipping like when you got smart contract settlement and maybe also AllUnity. So I'd like to see if there's a moat regarding GK8 and if at any moment you see GK8 having its own fierce moment, if I may.\n\n## Michael Novogratz (Executives)\nYes. Listen, the tokenization process itself is not so complicated, right? I think where you're going to see the value over time is connecting the entire infrastructure process, which is like capital raising in some ways, right, figuring out what assets should be tokenized or can be tokenized, and how to distribute those and then where those distributed assets sit in custody. It's kind of a complex web.\r\nGK is an important part of our infrastructure plan as well as our staking business, right? GK8 has built our tokenization engine, and they've been a key part of the AllUnity plan. But we're all still relatively early in this. We're hoping to announce some partnerships very soon with traditional TradFi players, where we're partnering in those infrastructure pieces. And so we're both going to do our own infrastructure and then a lot of partnerships around that.\r\nNobody is really tokenizing at scale right now. And some of that, I think, will change in the next 18 months. I think once you get clarity from the bill that hopefully gets passed in Washington in the next few months, the market structure bill. Once you also get understanding of where these tokenized security assets will trade, right now, they need to trade on ATSs and there are not a lot of big liquid pools around ATSs. And so all the pieces aren't in place yet for the tokenization world to really explode, but we're really close. And I think we're going to be making a lot of pivots and investments along the next few months to make sure that we're part of that future.\n\n## Jonathan Goldowsky (Executives)\nWe're going to go with Bizar [indiscernible] next. Please go ahead and unmute yourself and ask your question.\n\n## Michael Novogratz (Executives)\nYou got to love a guy named Bizar.\n\n## Unknown Analyst (Analysts)\nI feel I owe you an apology actually because you just mentioned it. My name is Victor. My name is Victor [indiscernible], and I've been here for the third time in a row. And it seems like I won't be able to get back my official X account, so I've had somewhat of a spat with Elon and X over some of the algorithm shortcomings. And I just want to make sure you know that I'm a real human being. This is just my fun account, the only one I can use. I'm an institutional asset manager, actually oversee a 40 billion operation, and I'm a personal investor in Galaxy coming on my own behalf, and I thank you for having me.\r\nWhat I want to say just before I dive into the questions, I want to say a thank you to you and your teams. I think a lot of people on this call have made a good amount of money of the hard work you guys have been putting in. The layers of the business are many, and I know how much grind you've put in, so just to thank you for the hard work you guys put in for your investors.\n\n## Michael Novogratz (Executives)\nAppreciate it.\n\n## Unknown Analyst (Analysts)\nNow my question, first one is with regards to something you said on the Empire podcast. You alluded to how the data center business, even though it's so prominently stated, I think the quote you used is, \"It's merely 10% of your time of your brain power.\" I was wondering if you could perhaps talk us through from an investor standpoint, what are sort of the other 90% of what's on your brain and really, in doing so, also stress the risks that are most pertinent to you when you manage this business together with Tony, what is it you allocate your brain power to? What are the risks you're most actively managing?\n\n## Michael Novogratz (Executives)\nSure. It's a fair question. Let me state by the first premise is that I couldn't only spend 10% of my brain power on the data center if Chris Ferraro wasn't spending 40% to 50% of his, right? Chris is a beast. And he was perfectly suited for a business like this because he's got a structured finance background. He understands how to get financing as does Tony. And this stuff is you better be reading the contracts. And I'm not a real contract reader, and Chris goes through with a fine-tooth comb these 400-page leases. And so we got the right guy at Galaxy of managing that process.\r\nListen, the crypto business is a lot more complicated in terms of the decisions one needs to make about where this industry is going. Like we all say tokenization is going to happen, but how and when and where is the liquidity going to be? What exchanges are they going to trade on. And so part of this is looking at the chessboard and trying to make the right decisions. I spent a lot of my time thinking about what talent we need and how to recruit that talent, right?\r\nOur best assets go up and down the elevator every day, right? This is a human capital business. And not only recruiting talent, but getting them to work together to a common goal is a big part of a lot of my brainpower. I spent a decent amount of my time telling the Galaxy story. A lot of you guys on Twitter gave me a wrath of s*** for years for not talking about Galaxy enough.\r\nAnd we heard you loud and clear. Some of that was because we were a Canadian company that was stuck in a 5-year listing process in the U.S. And when you're in that process, you're not allowed to speak about your company because that's called pumping the well or priming the well. And so I had kind of a gag order, but now we don't. And we want to make sure people understand the value of our company and the story of our company to bring in liquidity, right?\r\nWhat you realize is stock price is pretty correlated with volume and liquidity. And so great that we had over 4,000 people on our Twitter earnings call -- on our YouTube earnings call today. That's way up from when we were 9 months ago. And so that's part of the job. And then I oversee the liquid risk here. I'm 30-year macro veteran. Crypto at its core is macro, right?\r\nWhat's driving the big moves in Bitcoin and the other coins and the other ecosystems is a story about dollar debasement. And so I spent a decent amount of my time in my old networks, talking to the macro traders, understanding like the geopolitics of the world and the market environment of the world so we can make the right decisions around our balance sheet. And so when you put it all together, it's a full-time job, I promise.\n\n## Unknown Analyst (Analysts)\nI have no doubt about that. I mean, last time we spoke about, for instance, CoreWeave credit risk and you alluded to how you're managing this. Is there any other really prominent other risk you're currently focusing on something you can share with us?\n\n## Michael Novogratz (Executives)\nYes. Listen, the whole world is complicated right now, right? We've got a really polarized country. And so the politics of our country have never been worse and that creates nervousness and uncertainty. We have what feels to most people like we're in some stage of a bubble around data centers and AI. And what I've said over and over is bubbles happen around things that fundamentally change the way we live. If it was the railroad bubble or the Internet bubble, right, like the railroads really did change the way we live, just like the Internet did.\r\nAI will do so as well, which means prices will get way higher than probably the reality will be over a long period of time. Nobody knows if we're in the middle third quarter or fourth quarter of this frenzy. But so we're trying to manage -- how do you manage that risk as best you can, knowing that at one point in the next few years, you'll have a pretty sizable washout, right?\r\nAll this CapEx that's being spent isn't all going to make money. Some of it will make a ton of money and some of it won't. And so how do you hedge and how do you prepare for that inevitable. And again, I don't know if the inevitable is in 3 months or 3 years. And I don't think anyone else does either, but there will be an inevitable pullback because there's just too much capital being spent and not all of it is going to be productive.\n\n## Unknown Analyst (Analysts)\nI mean we also -- NVIDIA putting the money into OpenAI, and that kind of rings the alarm bells to some extent. I think you alluded to it?\n\n## Michael Novogratz (Executives)\nThere is a story that you can create a vendor financing of all this stuff, right? I mean OpenAI is -- has got obligations that far, far, far exceed its revenue right now. Well, if it can prove itself that it's growing revenue, it's going to be an amazing -- have an amazing ability and flip to profitability, an amazing ability to borrow money to meet those obligations. And if it can, it won't.\r\nLike right now, it seems like it can raise equity at ever higher valuations and almost as much as it can, but that doesn't last forever. And so in lots of ways, OpenAI is the linchpin. And in some ways, it's too big to fail because our government really fundamentally believes, and I think this is not just the Trump administration. I think this is probably bipartisan that winning AI is existential for the long-term success of the United States, that rightfully or wrongfully, they see this as a cold war against China. And this is an arms race.\r\nI personally don't, but who cares what I think. I know the government does. And so I don't think either government, if the Democrats were in charge or the Republicans are going to let the U.S. lose the AI arms race. And so that -- you put all together, it's a complicated equation. And that has to be -- I spent a ton of time thinking about that risk, talking to smart people about that risk. And if you start seeing cracks, what does that mean for -- what are the moves Galaxy needs to make?\n\n## Unknown Analyst (Analysts)\nI appreciate that. It very much resonates with my thinking on the framework -- on the risks in this framework. Now if I may ask you on hiring because you alluded to it yourself, I've been in for securitization in the mid-2000s, and I know how tough hiring can get when you really are growing when you're in that phase, when you need that human capital. Could you share with us how you're structurally going about that? And actually, for what it's worth, I would love to know how one best applies to Galaxy, too.\n\n## Michael Novogratz (Executives)\nYes. Listen, we have a website. We post tons of job offerings. You can see some of the guys on Twitter or on X are really, really savvy. They're always looking at those job offerings to try to understand what we're doing in our data center business. I get a kick out of that. The easiest way to hire people in a growing business is through reference. right?\r\nGuys on the desk that have friends and colleagues at other places that know they're A players. But we post everything. We have multiple headhunters that work for us. We have a big HR department. Now they're called the people department, but our people department is active. And then each business leader is actually the one who's finally responsible for building out their teams. And so you can go to the website, galaxy-com-careers, and it lists all our job offerings.\r\nJust to give you some sense, our summer internship program last year that had 25 summer interns. And nowadays, the summer intern is kind of an addition to get a full-time job. right? We will probably hire 75% of those interns. We had 15,000 applicants, 25 spots. People like our company. They like our industry. And it's really freaking tough for young people to get jobs right now, right? With the advent of AI, with the economy the way it is, it's never been harder for 22-year-old college grads to get jobs. And so we have -- and the hardest thing for us is how do you sort through all these qualified candidates to get someone who's awesome, who fits your culture. And we work really hard at that.\n\n## Unknown Analyst (Analysts)\nThat's awesome for you, but also awesome for us as investors.\n\n## Jonathan Goldowsky (Executives)\nWe're going to move on to Tyler Michetti of Tyler Investing.\n\n## Tyler Michetti (Analysts)\nMy name is Tyler, a retail investor here. I've been following Galaxy for the past year now. Excited to see where you guys go with this. I actually have a question about Helios. Given the energy dynamics in Texas and how the rest of the build-out is going, can you guys talk a little bit about how Helios is being optimized for power grid and what kind of benefits you expect that to provide once Helios is fully operational?\n\n## Michael Novogratz (Executives)\nYes. So the interesting thing about being part of the ERCOT grid is you get to draw power from the grid, right? We're not building behind the meter. We're grid users. And what's the grid job is to say, all these new applications to draw power from us, what are we going to look like in 5 years and 10 years' time? And will the grid be able to sustain this kind of power demand. And so in lots of ways, that responsibility is ERCOT's with their partners, right? WETT and AEP, which is the power provider that we use.\r\nAnd so for us, it's making sure that our applications have the best chance of being approved by them. And that is working with each of those bureaucracies to make sure they get the test results and the studies that they need to realize that we'll be able to pull the next 800 megawatts to 2.7 gigawatts of power and the grid will be able to withstand that.\r\nWhen the power goes into the box, and Chris Ferraro talked to this, this morning, right, that's where we're handing off the baton to CoreWeave, who has really developed a world-class, best-in-class ability to get the most out of the chips, the way they stack them, the way they connect them. And so we decided that was not going to be one of the domain expertise is at this point we focused on. It's why we partnered with CoreWeave. And so we really have the role here of land, power connectivity and then finding the right tenants.\n\n## Tyler Michetti (Analysts)\nAwesome. And I actually have a follow-up. If you can provide any new update on the remaining build-out of Helios and whether you're incorporating any new technology that maybe you haven't explained yet? And potentially, are you maybe going to do more in-house expansion or joint ventures, potentially hosting other companies?\n\n## Michael Novogratz (Executives)\nYes. Right now, we've got the 800 megawatts is spoken for from CoreWeave, and that's the plan. And so we're a one-tenant single purpose-built campus. When we get the next approval of more power, we're going to look really carefully, do we diversify away from CoreWeave to other tenants or not. And that will be a real, I think, healthy discussion. The reason you diversify is because having multiple tenants is always a good risk mitigant.\r\nAnd listen, we've been paid a whole lot to work with CoreWeave, and they've been great partners. And so we're certainly going to -- that can be the first conversation we have. And as time passes, the technology is shifting quickly. And so we can already see that the first 200-megawatt Phase 1 that we're doing for CoreWeave, Phase 2 is going to look different. They're going to pack things tighter. They're going to get more usage out of the same amount of megawatts and same amount of space.\r\nAnd so I think each iteration will be a little different than the last one. And we're more of in the -- we're not driving that process. We're helping, but we're really -- we're riding along that process, working with our GC, our in-house people, but mostly with our tenants.\n\n## Jonathan Goldowsky (Executives)\nZac Prince, we just had a question come in over Twitter for you. The question is from [ Nguyen Dinh Bao ], who wants to know if we have any plans to expand GalaxyOne to Canada and generally beyond the United States?\n\n## Zac Prince (Executives)\nYes, sure thing. So first, this is my first time talking on one of these spaces. I just wanted to say I'm thrilled to be here. I've been at Galaxy for just over 6 months now, and the team at Galaxy is truly remarkable and world-class. And there's just so much energy and excitement around so many different parts of the business right now that it's a thrill to be a part of.\r\nI'm also kind of addicted to Twitter and have been for a while, so being able to speak directly to a lot of the folks here who I see your post regularly is also an honor. So thanks. In terms of expanding GalaxyOne outside of the U.S., we will absolutely be doing that. It's not something that is on our super short-term part of the road map. And the reason for that is a lot of the products that we're offering are kind of highly regulated financial services products. And our focus, at least to start is on the U.S. market, but we will absolutely be expanding into Canada.\r\nStill a little bit TBD in terms of what exactly that product mix will look like when we do expand, but we will get there. And I've heard a number of folks from Canada, parts of Europe and other places request access to some of the things that we're doing at GalaxyOne, and we hear you, and it is on the road map, but don't expect something there like in the next 6 months.\n\n## Jonathan Goldowsky (Executives)\nThanks, Zac. Mike, we've got a couple more that came through via X, which I'm going to kick over to you. The first one is from Laser [indiscernible], who said that Tom Lee is saying that DAT is in a bubble, and we recorded $40 million of fees from our DAT activity over the past several quarters. Do you think that DAT fee revenue will be a significant revenue source in the future? And how is the competitive landscape given some of the fees that Galaxy is charging for these services?\n\n## Michael Novogratz (Executives)\nYes. Listen, I think we were smart and moved fast to get a lot of long-term contracts to manage DAT money. And so that will keep our asset management business busy and profitable for a while. I pray those DATs grow because if those DATs grow, our assets under management grow. And some are growing. Tom Lee is doing a brilliant job at Bitminer of raising new equity and building his asset base every week, right?\r\nMichael Saylor did the best job and MicroStrategy has slowed down in its growth. And you're going to probably see feast or famine in these DATs. Some are going to be great businesses. Others are going to be what I will call closed-end funds with decent assets.\r\nI think the acceleration of DATs is going to slow, right? I think we're at the tail end of using DATs to raise capital for the crypto business. And I say that because the 3 biggest ecosystems, quite frankly, the 4 biggest ecosystems all have raised significant DATs. And so you don't need 15 Solana DATs or 15 Bitcoin DATs. And so now there's a place where public equity markers -- public equity investors can go to play with DATs space. They also have the ETF space. And so -- and crypto people still have normal crypto space. And you're going to see all these things converge over time. And so I think Tom is right that we had -- we probably hit peak DAT, but I don't think that means the revenue from those DATs goes away.\n\n## Jonathan Goldowsky (Executives)\nThanks, Mike. We got one more on the Twitter comments from [ Bombaclat ], who wants to know what the plan is for next year, what targets do we have in place after such a huge jump in net income and also importantly, wanted to let you know that we are all Nakamigos.\n\n## Michael Novogratz (Executives)\nI love the Nakamigos. So shout out to you guys. Listen, I think the most exciting thing that will happen next year for Galaxy is that by the middle of the year, Helios starts cash flowing. And that will just be cool because we know it's like you turn your hose on, it starts off coming slowly and then as you turn and turn, the water comes out faster and faster. That's the way to think of Helios.\r\nWe start cash flowing probably end of the first quarter and by the end of the year, it's really cash flowing. And 18 months after that, it's hundreds of millions of dollars per quarter. And that changes the dynamic of this place immensely. And so in some ways, we've got a year to keep grinding before the Helios cash flow machine turns on.\r\nEach year, we approach the crypto business relatively similarly. We approach it scared and optimistic, like scared that we know it's a very volatile space and that we've lived through a bunch of cycles and they can be painful, optimistic in that we're seeing so many new opportunities show up. We wouldn't be hiring people if we didn't think we're now at the precipice of really becoming part of the financial landscape of the world, right?\r\nCrypto was kind of a science project. For the first few years, we were running Galaxy, and now it's integrating with traditional finance at an accelerating pace. One of the metrics we look at is assets on platform, right? The more assets we have on platform, that's staking assets, asset management assets, assets in our lending book, those are recurring revenue things, and they give the company more and more ballast and so we don't have enough of that yet for me to sleep like a baby, maybe we never will because I don't sleep that much. But that's our goal as a firm is to continue to build those assets that are recurring revenue, knowing that this is going to stay a volatile space for a while. I hope that helps.\n\n## Jonathan Goldowsky (Executives)\nThanks, Mike. Maybe I'll kick it back over to you. It doesn't look like we have any more questions in the queue for some final remarks to wrap this one up.\n\n## Michael Novogratz (Executives)\nYes. Guys, I really appreciate this community. We were frustrated for years with the stock that felt undervalued and didn't trade a lot. And in no small part from a lot of you guys on this chat, people have started to hear our story and getting engaged in our stock. That's my job as CEO, but you guys are amazing helpers in understanding our stock.\r\nThe questions we get on Twitter spaces or on X spaces are often as insightful as the ones we get from the paid professionals at the big investment banks. And so I think we are seeing the democratization of finance happen before our eyes and all you guys are a big part of that. So I want to say thanks, and we'll see you next quarter.\n",

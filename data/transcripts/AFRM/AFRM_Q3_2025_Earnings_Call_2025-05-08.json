So when a merchant shows up and says, \"Hey, I'm thinking of doing a giant 0% promo this quarter,\" our answer is always going to be, absolutely let's do this. Like yes, it makes a little bit less money, but the brand halo that drives for us, the conversion that the merchant sees and therefore, attaches themselves to Affirm that much more. The incremental volume to them is just like it's all goodness up and down. And so part of what you see in my letter this quarter is me saying, we had a handful of those opportunities come to us, and we just couldn't get enough of them.\r\nYou're totally right that the revenue and RLTC content is a little bit light. But on the other side of it, the credit quality is significantly better. I think I quoted some numbers in my notes that it's basically prime and super prime content. And so we will continue reacting towards that.\r\nOne of the really big things that is worth being clear about on the 0s, they are good today. In fact, I think they're great today, but they're really fantastic tomorrow. The totality of Affirm cardholders comes from the existing Affirm base. Every time we sign someone new through a 0% promo, some number of months or quarters from now, that is a prime candidate for card, and that's a lifetime value booster. We haven't come up with a better one. So that's why we're so happy with that. And it does create a little bit of delayed gratification, if you will, but it's totally worth it."

But otherwise, we really saw strong growth across the board, and that was both growing with our largest merchants and partners, but also growing across the merchant base. Obviously, we called out in the letter that the strong growth in our direct-to-consumer services those grew faster than the rest of the business at large. It was led by card, of course. But yes, really, it was strong growth.\r\nI mean the other thing that we called out in the letter was just that we did see growth accelerate across the quarter, with March being our strongest month of growth at 40% GMV growth year-on-year."

      "text": "I'll start and undoubtedly, Rob has much more precise contours around. Yes -- the thing in promotional finance is everybody promises you 0s, no one except for us, actually delivers on it. 99.999% of the time, somebody says, \"Hey, it is 0% APR.\" There's an asterisk next to it. And if you read the fine print, it says, if you miss a payment or you're late or something happens or it rains or it's a Thursday, you will get screwed, and interest compounds attractively and it's the worst thing in the world. We don't do any of those things when we tell you it's a 0% APR, it is, in fact, a 0% APR.\r\nAt this point, we've actually earned our right/brand. People know when Affirm says it's a 0% deal, it is, in fact, you will pay no interest for as long as the number of months says. And so people respond to it very positively, the conversion rate on those sort of things is better than it's ever been. Merchants come to us and say, hey, we want to really boost our top line. Let's run a 0. We'll pay the interest that consumers would have otherwise paid. Let's go for that. That typically -- very, very rarely in fact, I can't remember a time where we said, no, we're not interested. Any time this happens, we say, \"Oh my god, of course, we would love to accommodate you. Let's go now and let's do as often as possible.\"\r\nSo in that sense, it's just a great thing right now. Yes, it has great credit externalities. It converts really well, et cetera, et cetera. It's also extremely on brand for us. So this is a really important brand deposit that we're making. It also drives GMV growth.\r\nAnd so generally speaking, I don't have a framework in my mind, but the top point, it's too much. The card user acquisition thing is a cherry on top. It's not a thing we do because we want more card users, even though, of course, we want more car users. It's the fact that when we do this, it results in a disproportionately higher percentage of qualified card users. The card credit quality requirements that we have are higher than the broad Affirm quality requirements. And so in that sense, the more 0s we run, the higher percentage of card eligible users we have. That's the qualitative answer, now to Rob for quantitative."

And do we have maybe some surplus that we can invest through mix, not necessarily by subsidizing the MDR for merchants, but just through mix alone to help drive all of the beneficial things that come with 0 that Max alluded to, right? So modestly better credit, higher growth, slightly better user acquisition, right? All those things are added benefits, and we think that they drive really nice network effects for us as well."

      "text": "Let's see. So first of all, it's not a precise estimate. The numbers should give you a pretty good clue that this is 15 and 10 are fairly general levels. What we've done is we've looked at past experience. So during COVID, we had some changes we have to implement pretty quickly because of the extremely sudden nature of the furloughs and layoffs. And then in '22, '23, it's a little bit slower, but it was also a little bit of a fire drill. And so in both times, we had to estimate sort of what's the credit results we wanted in that period of time. And empirically, find our way to the right approval rates, the numbers I gave are roughly what we saw then. And then as we do our recession preparedness, which we always do, it's not a thing that we sort of started doing at some recent time, we just look at recession scenarios as a matter of habit, we model out what happens over what period of time as delinquencies and defaults go up.\r\nBasically, the process looks something like this. We just make assumptions about the existing back book and ask ourselves what are the changes we need to do to the front book to mix into the right returns for our investors so that we continue satisfying our capital markets obligations and feel good about the results overall.\r\nWe deliberately do not make assumptions around things like, well, of course, we'll do this and that and everything will get better. So there are pockets of improvements to be had after we make those credit cuts, but the assumptions are fairly black and white because that's the most conservative path to approach. And so that's the process. The numbers are empirically based from what we've seen as well as the models that we run here. I think capital markets sort of behaved in all sorts of erratic ways in the past. So we have that empirically well-known at this point."

I think you'll find that because the loan book turns over so quickly in our business, we tend to look much more closely at early signs of stress in our own loan book more so than we peg our assumptions or our scenario planning around external factors like U.S. unemployment rate or something like that. So it's really around if we saw repayment stress in our own loan book and we sprung to action what would those actions look like? And how much would we have to tighten underwriting or adjust our credit posture."

And you do seem to be at the forefront of your industry in doing that. So I just wanted to ask why is that something that's so important to you? And then is it challenging from like a tech perspective to build out that reporting and integration?"

      "text": "It's a great question. We do believe we are at the forefront of the industry in the sense. And it is challenging at the front end. So there's a couple of somewhat conflicting considerations in the scenario of reporting. So there's a very small handful of people that will tell you, don't report my loans, I don't want to -- I like the optionality of not paying my bills on time and having my credit score unchanged. There is an extreme minority. And some of our competitors love to speak to that minority. But I think the vast majority of the world says, hey, if I'm borrowing money, and I'm paying it back on time, I want that reflected on my permanent record. When I go to borrow money for a car or even get my credit check for an apartment rental, I want to know that if I borrowed from you, you help me build my credit history and ultimately help my credit score.\r\nAnd so that part is really important to us. We're absolutely not a social list enterprise, but we do believe in doing the right thing for our consumer. And our consumer really cares about their credit rating. So helping them build it is really important. There are some downsides to it in the follow way -- some like, the downside is the right term, sorry. You can't screw up. If you go to a credit bureau and you tell them, here's a bunch of data, do what you will with it. That is irresponsible. So we spent years literally testing what will happen to your credit score if the NPL data is included in it? What about monthly data? What about biweekly data? What if it combines with these other transactions that we see?\r\nAnd so we work very, very hard on making sure that we can stand up and say, we will report your data, if you pay us on time over time, your credit score will improve and it will not have weird consequences that you might be worried about, et cetera. And so that work was really significant. It took a lot of negotiating, took some real efforts with TransUnion and Experian. All these announcements you see is literally results of years and years of work.\r\nThe actual process of gathering the repayment data and sending it to the credit bureau is not especially technically challenging. You want to make sure your formatted data correctly, but that's not the hard part. The hard part is making sure that it's incorporated accurately represents the behavior truthfully, actually helps people build their scores, doesn't disproportionately benefit or punish them in strange or unexpected consequences.\r\nAnd I'll use this one second as the opportunity to pound the table. I invite all of our competitors to do the same thing. I think it's really important. I think this country is fueled by credit. And it is irresponsible of them not to deliver information to the bureaus. And by the way, whatever regulatory regime we are in or heading to, the right thing to do is to help people not stack loans, which is the #1 concern regulators of all types always have. If you're borrowing here and you're borrowing there, is at least important to know the total size of your overall debt. And we'll lead the way, we'll always do the right thing first, but I think it's really important in the industry embraces this price."

We basically have to build out all the functionality we have in mind, and we're working pretty hard towards that. But I would not expect the pay now volume to just flip up to crazy number a very quickly. So it's going to be a gradual process, and we're seeing good attach rates in cohorts, but we are not obviously yet predominant way for people to pay now. We're gaining traction pretty nicely in pay later, as in we're taking up more and more of the consumers' credit spend. The goal is, of course, to go after all transactions. What it will take. I'm not sure this is the right place on which to preannounce our product roadmap. And if I do, Mike, will elbow me, and it will hurt.\r\nBut I think the -- one of the things that we did, it's in my notes, we just rolled out foreign transactions, which seems like a really minor thing, but I called it out because there's no network effects in payments geographically, people just don't travel that much. But nothing sucks more than pulling out your debit card in a foreign land and saying, \"I'm going to buy this thing, swiping it, and it doesn't work.\" And so fixing these gaping user interface or user experience holes is disproportionately important for things like pay now, like you just wanted to be more bulletproof.\r\nAs we clean up those things, I think you will naturally see increased pay now. We have a bunch of ideas in what might we do to create incentives. For what it's worth the single most valuable consumer incentive we've come up with is the 0% APR, like it sounds sort of pedestrian, but we've run AB tests of all sorts and kinds. And we can offer you 10% off or 0% deal and 9 out of 10 times the 0% is just much more compelling, even though it cost the merchants less than 10%. And so just the economics of that trade are so powerful, we will continue leaning into API reductions as a reason to use Affirm products in all sorts of ways, and the card is certainly a giant driver of that.\r\nAnd obviously, there's a bit of a rhyming where if you signed up 3 0% promote, you'd like to see more of those. And so creating more of those in the card is pretty valuable."

The #1 reason -- the reason we have the app and the #1 reason it's used for is to pay your loan back. So as much as we love tinkering with user interface, the #1 guardrail we run against is -- has our repayment rate changed in a way that we don't like.\r\nAnd so you'll actually see us trickle out quite a number of incremental user interface changes, which every one of them moves some needle somewhere positively on the conversion side of things, always against the backdrop of are we improving or hurting repayment? And if it's ever hurting, those changes don't survive very long. We're very, very careful not to miss with our repayment rates.\r\nThere's some really good stuff coming in the apps, like that's not visible yet. So it's -- I would say ask me this question maybe next quarter, and you'll be able to ask like, hey, you changed this thing and looks cool. If you look through the Affirm Card pre-approval process or loan pre-approval process, you'll see them really need changes towards the end of the flow .That's a good breadcrumb if you wanted to go spelunk some user flows, see what we did.

In other words, whatever it is we do to the app in pursuit of other goals, we will not compromise repayments. Like this is sort of all consistent with the credit is job #1 thing that I love to repeat. We will never do something that harms repayment because it; one, hurts our capital partners; two, screws up our ability to sign more capital partners, et cetera, et cetera. So that's the guardrail and it's probably -- the reason we don't talk about it is because it's understood, and we will not mess with the repayment.\r\nThat said, the app fundamentally is two more things. It's a catalog of merchants and their offers, most importantly, 0% offers, that are currently available on the network. And it's really important in the sense that consumers do not come to the app to start their shopping journeys. When they do come to the app for in addition to repaying their bills, is to check if a thing or a merchant they're interested in has a great financing offer, be at 0% or a reduced APR or a longer period or increased purchasing power, there's many different kinds of promos that we know how to run, and we know how to run very profitably, both for our partners and for ourselves and delight consumers.\r\nAnd over time, we will send out more reasons to consumers to come to the app to check in on the offers available to them. One of the things that we rolled out within our Adaptive Checkout solution that lives on merchant sites is something that we've built for the app a little while ago, it's called dynamic optimization, which in real time, figures out the best possible terms, by that I mean term length of the loans you might take out, and APR offers for that single consumer given something we know about their current set of interests.\r\nMaybe the best possible approximation for the app, which will sound a little controversial, but actually I think it probably is the best way of -- I read about it, it's a search engine, that you come and query on the topic of I have this thing in mind or I have this merchant in mind, what's the smartest financial decision I can make with Affirm as my tool for -- to fulfill the financial objective. And we expect to lean into answering that question more and more and more. And you can sort of imagine some product ideas and maybe features that come out of that.\r\nThe search engine that we have today is pretty good. We are working on improvements on that pretty relentlessly. I think if I'm allowed a super minor comment on the topic that's not come up yet for which I'm somewhat thankful. If you look at how the world is changing in the context of generative AI, every search is going to be an AI conversation, like that's very, very apparent at this point, you should absolutely expect us to have an answer for that as well."

So in the sense that whatever we have in a pipeline that we have signed going live, if they're on Adyen today, will be a faster process. And we have many of those relationships in the U.S. This one isn't the first one internationally, but it's definitely I think the most significant or the most visible one right now.\r\nIn terms of the sense for things in the U.K., just came back from London. I feel like I'm spending half my time in London at this point. Going well, doubling down on sales. I spent a lot of time visiting merchants. Obviously, we are the upstart brand in the market. So I have to spend a lot of time just educating the market about who we are, how we do business, how we're a little bit different from the incumbents.\r\nObviously, we already said out loud, so it's no surprise. The big step function will come when we take Shopify live there, and that's definitely a horizon. We're working towards that.

So we are applying -- and unfortunately, the world has gotten really confused about what is and isn't AI under today's definition versus yesterday's definition. So I'll try to be very precise. So we've used machine learning since the day of our founding. In fact, the idea was to build a credit score that was built on alternative data and modern machine learning techniques. And obviously, we've been pretty successful with it. So we use that all the time, every part of the business, et cetera. So that's just sort of the baseline.\r\nGenAI or LLMs large language models have been really, really helpful in a bunch of places.  Internally, we use them in all kinds of ways, including -- and we're actually quite actively investing into internal adoption of AI, where we have teams that are tasked with finding use cases for GenAI specifically inside their teams or increasing productivity, anything from -- we have literally hundreds of thousands of legal contracts with merchants. You need to find a clause that we need to modify for whatever reason. That's a great task for LLM, read 435,000 contracts or whatever the current number is, find the clause that we need to change, which is very suddenly different contract to contract, summarize it and construct a thing that we need to go out there and get resigned.\r\nSo that's the thing that humans would take thousands of hours for potentially, it can be done in minutes with the AI. And this isn't a made-up example, it's very real.\r\nThe thing that I referred to in the letter, a big part of consumer delight is -- at least for us anyway, is transparency and speed to resolution. And the ability to speak to a human and explain your case is really powerful. That's one thing that I don't think will ever go away, like having empathy from someone who gets it and can actually speak to you with a human emotion in their voice, machines aren't there yet, and it may actually be irreducible.\r\nBut if you kind of know what you want and you don't want to wait and you have it all figured out, most importantly, have the evidence that there's a dispute and it's just going to go a very specific way, and we can use machine learning to adjudicate the outcome, you can package the entire thing with GenAI and say, all right, let's have an interaction. And you understand you're talking to a robot, but this robot can take in all your evidence, process it, run it through machine learning model in the back end and say, yes, this basically means you get a refund. We'll tell you right now, the return is coming, you're going to be okay. We'll take care of the rest. That is a huge booster of customer satisfaction.\r\nAnd so that's actually -- that's what I'm referring to in the letter. That's also an example of both GenAI as a user interface and machine learning on a back end as a resolution device. Machine learning is much more stable, if you will, the models are highly, highly predictable and repeatable. That's why they're favored in precise things like credit underwriting. And GenAI models are somewhat less predictable, everybody has heard about hallucinations, but they make for an amazing, very flexible user interface. And we use both very actively, I'll skip the part where I talk about how we have lots of engineers using lots of AI to write code and so on. But obviously, we're doing that as well.\r\nSo we don't spend a ton of time talking about it. We are very enthusiastic adapters of -- adopters of oldest new stuff, but we also kind of think that it's a bit of a set of tools you use what is available to you and you try to find the very best ones and you maybe don't make such a big story out of it."

And so we get a pretty fulsome data set every day as those cohorts are coming in for repayment 30 days later. So we're not seeing any signs of stress with the consumer in the repayment rates.\r\nOne small thing that did happen during the quarter is we actually saw a slight uptick in prepayments. And so we take that as a pretty positive credit signal, actually. It is -- there is some tax seasonality, but even adjusting for that, we saw an increase year-on-year in prepayments. So we think that's a modest positive. And that does on the margin change the mix of loans that are still on the balance sheet. And we still feel like the allowance rate, while up marginally is still in a really healthy place. And I think delinquencies are a good leading indicator of where the credit box is and how the book is performing."

Number one, that really does not apply here, and it's important to just get that out of the way. Even if we woke up tomorrow morning with a bank charter in our back pocket, we would not be able to lend from deposits that, that bank had. It would take a long time to gather deposits. It would be regulatorily encumbered in what's called de novo period where you really wouldn't be able to do all that much at all with it. And so it's -- a bank charter is just not a solution for our funding strategy. That's sort of full stop.\r\nAnd if we had a bank charter tomorrow, 5 years from now, we can have a conversation about what is that doing for your funding cost and even then probably not. So that's not a thing.\r\nThere are two other things. There's regulatory certainty where if you have your own charter, you can have a little bit more clarity as to how the regulators think of you, the bank partner model gets interrogated by the regulators, both federal and state level fairly frequently. We have done really well. It obviously doesn't hurt that we look our bank partner -- make our bank partners look good by not charging any late fees, by not doing any questionable anti-consumer things. So our partnerships have been strong, and we've enjoyed a plurality of bank partnerships over the years. That's said, there's some argument to be had there.\r\nThe most important thing, and I said it before and I'll say it again, we are regulatorily driven or motivated towards features or by features. In other words, if there were a feature that we just couldn't build without a bank charter, we would absolutely consider pursuing one. And there is a handful of those. There's no point in sort of rattling them off, but you could construct a straw man around. You would want to do this because it's great for consumers, it's on mission. Affirm would be good at it, and yet you can't because there's no bank charter. If and when we prioritize one of those things, bank charter will become part of the consideration.\r\nAnd that's where -- we've been in that mode for quite some time, and you're totally right that the current regulators, I think, have publicly called for wanting to see more applications. So it's not lost on us, but we would do it if we felt the need to pursue it for a product construct that we had in mind.\r\nMichael, now on competition."

The category will, we believe, remain competitive well into the future, anytime a category is being defined like ours where there's meaningful adoption of a new category. It attracts competition from pure players, but also attract competition from the comments in the broader consumer credit space, who would like to compete. That has been true for the past 5 years. We include in our supplement, a chart that shows the trends of our merchant fee rates over the past 5 years -- over the past several years, sorry.\r\nAnd it's -- the thing that jumps out to me and hopefully to investors is how consistent our pricing has been despite the extreme competitive environment. And the reason why is we don't win on price. We obviously have to put forward competitive pricing and our cost structure and ability to do things that we do in the capital markets allows us to be aggressive. But it's really important given the risk management mindset that we have in our business that we can generate enough profit to operate the business the way we want to operate it, which means we don't do the same thing that some competition might do with respect to pricing.\r\nWe win on conversion, we win on impact. We win on putting ourselves out there for the consumers of the brands that we work with. And I think the track record we have on our distribution is evidence of that. And I think the more successful we are improving, there's a really good business to be had here, the more competition it will attract. We've never thought about our contracts or our distribution as being something that cements our leadership. We have to earn it every day by driving real impact for our merchant partners. And that's where our focus certainly lies. But make no mistake, we think the market is competitive and will remain competitive for as long as we're out changing the world."

I mean, what do we generally take away in periods where you see particularly some of the larger enterprise partners want to lean into it.

And in our experience, merchants who are wanting to do 0% promotions tend to be the ones who are most growth-oriented. It's a reflection of strength in those merchants where they really want to go out and be front-footed and grow their businesses. It's an incredibly powerful growth tool for them.\r\nI think the truth is when we were dealing with a surge in rates and associated pressures to the merchant partners, it became very difficult to make the economics work for these. But when you're in a scenario that we were most of this quarter and certainly the prior couple of quarters where the market conditions were favorable for the provider and Affirm and the brands really wanted to invest dollars in growth, it's a great lever to pull. Where I think merchants pull back on 0s is when they feel like they need to be less growthful and more focused on the cost structure of the business. And so I've always thought about it as a real sign of strength for the merchants, knowing that, that's a great way for them to grow their business. There's nothing defensive about that.\r\nThe last thing to note is really important. Our merchant partners are reactive. I think they're some of the best retailers in the world. But even with that, they don't react in minutes and days. These things take months to think about and plan and execute. And as a result, I think it would be a big mistake to look at what we saw this quarter and associated with anything you're reading in the news."

Some of the largest merchants that chose to run 0 this quarter really have business models where they're both selling direct to consumer and then they're also selling into a distribution channel. And when you look at the unit level economics for that merchant, selling direct is the most profitable action they can do. And so while the MDRs that they're paying to Affirm might be higher than credit card processing rate that they're paying on the direct channel, if they can drive more volume through direct, it's still really accretive to their gross margins versus selling into wholesale or selling into a channel."

Again, that was only about 10% of the 0% volume, and we can dictate the exact cutoffs for when the 0% is presented, and we can filter there either based on the credit quality of the consumers. It may be obvious that I'll say it anyway, higher credit quality consumers, there typically are lower costs for us elsewhere in the transaction. And so we can lean in by foregoing some of the interest revenue that we would get in an interest-bearing loan and present more 0s as a result.\r\nBut yes, that's really how we're thinking about it.

And we can play with the mix of 0s that we want to run in any given quarter and be thoughtful about the consumers we present 0s to and when and why."

And to the Peloton point that you raised, Peloton was obviously a very long-dated loan program, and it had a very, very high percentage of 0% loans. And so it's all together just a different equation. The 0s that we saw this quarter clustered around roughly 12 months in term length. And so the MDR that we need to make the math work there is just -- it's different than a 3-year loan program like we had with Peloton..."

We look at the merchant fees that we get either through the merchant discount rate and a negotiated deal or the interchange on the card, including Visa flexible credential interchange, and we make a financing offer based upon that revenue mix. There's always revenue in the picture. When we talk about self-funding, what we mean is that we can intentionally direct a higher mix of offers to that consumer. And maybe that means we're intentionally accepting slightly lower margin. But we're not walking into situations and saying, let's go acquire users by offering 24 months 0% promotional financing. That's just not the business model."

  "text": "# Affirm Holdings, Inc. - Q3 2025 Earnings Call\nDate: 2025-05-08T21:00:00Z\nType: Earnings Calls\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nGood afternoon. Welcome to the Affirm Holdings Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available on our Investor Relations website for a reasonable period of time after the call.\r\nI'd like to turn the call over to Zane Keller, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\n## Zane Keller (Executives)\nThank you, operator. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone listening that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our filings with the SEC which are available on our Investor Relations website. Actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and the company does not assume any obligation or intent to update them, except as required by law.\r\nIn addition, today's call may include non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for GAAP financial measures. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings supplement slide deck, which is available on our Investor Relations website.\r\nHosting today's call with me are Max Levchin, Affirm's Founder and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Linford, Affirm's Chief Operating Officer; and Rob O'Hare, Affirm's Chief Financial Officer.\r\nIn line with our practice in prior quarters, we will begin with brief opening remarks from Max before proceeding immediately into questions and answers.\r\nOn that note, I will turn the call over to Max to begin.\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nThank you, Zane. The quarter's results, of course, speak for themselves. We are pleased to improve our outlook for the current quarter and the fiscal year. This quarter is a good example of us leaning into growth opportunities with excellent credit quality and LTV characteristics while hitting our targets. As we continue our journey as a soon to be GAAP profitable business, we'll continue to be judicious in how we spend our hard-earned dollars and as opportunities to take market share arise, we'll keep balancing growth and profitability.\r\nBack to you, Zane.\n\n## Zane Keller (Executives)\nGreat. Thank you, Max. With that, operator, we're ready for our question-and-answer session.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with William Blair.\n\n## Andrew Jeffrey (Analysts)\nMax, I noticed the call out again on the 0 APR product in the shareholder letter, you're having excellent traction. Can you talk a little bit about sort of the -- how you balance the economics of those loans versus interest-bearing loans and whether or not you're going to see or you think you can see more merchant sort of contribution to that product as you go forward? Because I think you noted it's a little bit lower RLTC than interest-bearing. So I'm just wondering about the mix implications and any other comments on 0 interest going forward?\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nSure. And it is a little bit responsive or reactive, if you will, versus proactive. So when a merchant shows up and says, \"Hey, I'm thinking of doing a giant 0% promo this quarter,\" our answer is always going to be, absolutely let's do this. Like yes, it makes a little bit less money, but the brand halo that drives for us, the conversion that the merchant sees and therefore, attaches themselves to Affirm that much more. The incremental volume to them is just like it's all goodness up and down. And so part of what you see in my letter this quarter is me saying, we had a handful of those opportunities come to us, and we just couldn't get enough of them.\r\nYou're totally right that the revenue and RLTC content is a little bit light. But on the other side of it, the credit quality is significantly better. I think I quoted some numbers in my notes that it's basically prime and super prime content. And so we will continue reacting towards that.\r\nOne of the really big things that is worth being clear about on the 0s, they are good today. In fact, I think they're great today, but they're really fantastic tomorrow. The totality of Affirm cardholders comes from the existing Affirm base. Every time we sign someone new through a 0% promo, some number of months or quarters from now, that is a prime candidate for card, and that's a lifetime value booster. We haven't come up with a better one. So that's why we're so happy with that. And it does create a little bit of delayed gratification, if you will, but it's totally worth it.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nNext question, Dan Dolev with Mizuho.\n\n## Dan Dolev (Analysts)\nExcellent results, as always. So Max and team, can you maybe elaborate a little bit on the pockets of strength in GMV that we're seeing right now and maybe some comments on Apple Pay and how much of this is sustainable on the April trends? Would really appreciate some comments.\n\n## Robert O'Hare (Executives)\nDan, this is Rob. Thanks for the question. The strength in GMV that we saw in the quarter, it really was incredibly broad-based. I think we had one category that declined. But otherwise, we really saw strong growth across the board, and that was both growing with our largest merchants and partners, but also growing across the merchant base. Obviously, we called out in the letter that the strong growth in our direct-to-consumer services those grew faster than the rest of the business at large. It was led by card, of course. But yes, really, it was strong growth.\r\nI mean the other thing that we called out in the letter was just that we did see growth accelerate across the quarter, with March being our strongest month of growth at 40% GMV growth year-on-year.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nNext question, Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen.\n\n## Moshe Orenbuch (Analysts)\nI was hoping you could perhaps flesh out the commentary on the 0%. You mentioned that they are generally much higher credit quality. And is this sort of the way to think about kind of an acquisition channel for the Affirm Card and just a different -- and if that's the case, and maybe could you talk a little bit about when you're going to be willing to do more of it and how we should kind of think about that?\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nI'll start and undoubtedly, Rob has much more precise contours around. Yes -- the thing in promotional finance is everybody promises you 0s, no one except for us, actually delivers on it. 99.999% of the time, somebody says, \"Hey, it is 0% APR.\" There's an asterisk next to it. And if you read the fine print, it says, if you miss a payment or you're late or something happens or it rains or it's a Thursday, you will get screwed, and interest compounds attractively and it's the worst thing in the world. We don't do any of those things when we tell you it's a 0% APR, it is, in fact, a 0% APR.\r\nAt this point, we've actually earned our right/brand. People know when Affirm says it's a 0% deal, it is, in fact, you will pay no interest for as long as the number of months says. And so people respond to it very positively, the conversion rate on those sort of things is better than it's ever been. Merchants come to us and say, hey, we want to really boost our top line. Let's run a 0. We'll pay the interest that consumers would have otherwise paid. Let's go for that. That typically -- very, very rarely in fact, I can't remember a time where we said, no, we're not interested. Any time this happens, we say, \"Oh my god, of course, we would love to accommodate you. Let's go now and let's do as often as possible.\"\r\nSo in that sense, it's just a great thing right now. Yes, it has great credit externalities. It converts really well, et cetera, et cetera. It's also extremely on brand for us. So this is a really important brand deposit that we're making. It also drives GMV growth.\r\nAnd so generally speaking, I don't have a framework in my mind, but the top point, it's too much. The card user acquisition thing is a cherry on top. It's not a thing we do because we want more card users, even though, of course, we want more car users. It's the fact that when we do this, it results in a disproportionately higher percentage of qualified card users. The card credit quality requirements that we have are higher than the broad Affirm quality requirements. And so in that sense, the more 0s we run, the higher percentage of card eligible users we have. That's the qualitative answer, now to Rob for quantitative.\n\n## Robert O'Hare (Executives)\nAnd I would just say much it really comes down to for us, where is the portfolio profitability at large? And do we have maybe some surplus that we can invest through mix, not necessarily by subsidizing the MDR for merchants, but just through mix alone to help drive all of the beneficial things that come with 0 that Max alluded to, right? So modestly better credit, higher growth, slightly better user acquisition, right? All those things are added benefits, and we think that they drive really nice network effects for us as well.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nNext question, Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.\n\n## Robert Wildhack (Analysts)\nI appreciate the commentary in the letter around your sensitivity to the recession scenario. I was wondering if you could unpack some of the assumptions that underpin that analysis. Obviously, be interested to know like what you considered for GDP and unemployment. But also if you assumed anything in that scenario with respect to the business, like 0% APRs increasing, decreasing or softening in the funding market, anything like that?\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nLet's see. So first of all, it's not a precise estimate. The numbers should give you a pretty good clue that this is 15 and 10 are fairly general levels. What we've done is we've looked at past experience. So during COVID, we had some changes we have to implement pretty quickly because of the extremely sudden nature of the furloughs and layoffs. And then in '22, '23, it's a little bit slower, but it was also a little bit of a fire drill. And so in both times, we had to estimate sort of what's the credit results we wanted in that period of time. And empirically, find our way to the right approval rates, the numbers I gave are roughly what we saw then. And then as we do our recession preparedness, which we always do, it's not a thing that we sort of started doing at some recent time, we just look at recession scenarios as a matter of habit, we model out what happens over what period of time as delinquencies and defaults go up.\r\nBasically, the process looks something like this. We just make assumptions about the existing back book and ask ourselves what are the changes we need to do to the front book to mix into the right returns for our investors so that we continue satisfying our capital markets obligations and feel good about the results overall.\r\nWe deliberately do not make assumptions around things like, well, of course, we'll do this and that and everything will get better. So there are pockets of improvements to be had after we make those credit cuts, but the assumptions are fairly black and white because that's the most conservative path to approach. And so that's the process. The numbers are empirically based from what we've seen as well as the models that we run here. I think capital markets sort of behaved in all sorts of erratic ways in the past. So we have that empirically well-known at this point.\n\n## Robert O'Hare (Executives)\nYes. And Rob, this is Rob O'Hare. I think you'll find that because the loan book turns over so quickly in our business, we tend to look much more closely at early signs of stress in our own loan book more so than we peg our assumptions or our scenario planning around external factors like U.S. unemployment rate or something like that. So it's really around if we saw repayment stress in our own loan book and we sprung to action what would those actions look like? And how much would we have to tighten underwriting or adjust our credit posture.\n\n## Robert Wildhack (Analysts)\nGot it. Okay. And then you hold a series of headlines recently highlighting integration and reporting back into the credit bureaus. And you do seem to be at the forefront of your industry in doing that. So I just wanted to ask why is that something that's so important to you? And then is it challenging from like a tech perspective to build out that reporting and integration?\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nIt's a great question. We do believe we are at the forefront of the industry in the sense. And it is challenging at the front end. So there's a couple of somewhat conflicting considerations in the scenario of reporting. So there's a very small handful of people that will tell you, don't report my loans, I don't want to -- I like the optionality of not paying my bills on time and having my credit score unchanged. There is an extreme minority. And some of our competitors love to speak to that minority. But I think the vast majority of the world says, hey, if I'm borrowing money, and I'm paying it back on time, I want that reflected on my permanent record. When I go to borrow money for a car or even get my credit check for an apartment rental, I want to know that if I borrowed from you, you help me build my credit history and ultimately help my credit score.\r\nAnd so that part is really important to us. We're absolutely not a social list enterprise, but we do believe in doing the right thing for our consumer. And our consumer really cares about their credit rating. So helping them build it is really important. There are some downsides to it in the follow way -- some like, the downside is the right term, sorry. You can't screw up. If you go to a credit bureau and you tell them, here's a bunch of data, do what you will with it. That is irresponsible. So we spent years literally testing what will happen to your credit score if the NPL data is included in it? What about monthly data? What about biweekly data? What if it combines with these other transactions that we see?\r\nAnd so we work very, very hard on making sure that we can stand up and say, we will report your data, if you pay us on time over time, your credit score will improve and it will not have weird consequences that you might be worried about, et cetera. And so that work was really significant. It took a lot of negotiating, took some real efforts with TransUnion and Experian. All these announcements you see is literally results of years and years of work.\r\nThe actual process of gathering the repayment data and sending it to the credit bureau is not especially technically challenging. You want to make sure your formatted data correctly, but that's not the hard part. The hard part is making sure that it's incorporated accurately represents the behavior truthfully, actually helps people build their scores, doesn't disproportionately benefit or punish them in strange or unexpected consequences.\r\nAnd I'll use this one second as the opportunity to pound the table. I invite all of our competitors to do the same thing. I think it's really important. I think this country is fueled by credit. And it is irresponsible of them not to deliver information to the bureaus. And by the way, whatever regulatory regime we are in or heading to, the right thing to do is to help people not stack loans, which is the #1 concern regulators of all types always have. If you're borrowing here and you're borrowing there, is at least important to know the total size of your overall debt. And we'll lead the way, we'll always do the right thing first, but I think it's really important in the industry embraces this price.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nNext question, Adam Frisch with Evercore ISI.\n\n## Adam Frisch (Analysts)\nQuick housekeeping and then I have a question on the AC card. If 0s didn't grow so fast and were more in line with the prior mix? What do you think RLTC would have been in the quarter?\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nWe haven't given precision around that, Adam, other than to say, 0s are profitable for us. They're profitable at the RLTC line, and they're just less profitable than an interest-bearing loan that's held. But just given the complexities of in-quarter funding mix and just taking a horizontal view of an asset that lends itself to a several quarters view, it's really hard to quantify that.\n\n## Adam Frisch (Analysts)\nOkay. No worries. Just want to ask also about any specific initiatives or incentives that you can speak to in order to get people using the Affirm Card more like a debit card. So you see them more get an even better understanding of their finances, et cetera? And if not, maybe provide some color on whether banking or debit or other financial services are on your roadmap, Max, I think you alluded to that very slightly in the last call. So I was hoping maybe to get a little more color on that.\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nIt's a good question. I'll try to keep it synced lest I get on the -- in the feature mode again. So to get to top of wallet, is a major effort. We basically have to build out all the functionality we have in mind, and we're working pretty hard towards that. But I would not expect the pay now volume to just flip up to crazy number a very quickly. So it's going to be a gradual process, and we're seeing good attach rates in cohorts, but we are not obviously yet predominant way for people to pay now. We're gaining traction pretty nicely in pay later, as in we're taking up more and more of the consumers' credit spend. The goal is, of course, to go after all transactions. What it will take. I'm not sure this is the right place on which to preannounce our product roadmap. And if I do, Mike, will elbow me, and it will hurt.\r\nBut I think the -- one of the things that we did, it's in my notes, we just rolled out foreign transactions, which seems like a really minor thing, but I called it out because there's no network effects in payments geographically, people just don't travel that much. But nothing sucks more than pulling out your debit card in a foreign land and saying, \"I'm going to buy this thing, swiping it, and it doesn't work.\" And so fixing these gaping user interface or user experience holes is disproportionately important for things like pay now, like you just wanted to be more bulletproof.\r\nAs we clean up those things, I think you will naturally see increased pay now. We have a bunch of ideas in what might we do to create incentives. For what it's worth the single most valuable consumer incentive we've come up with is the 0% APR, like it sounds sort of pedestrian, but we've run AB tests of all sorts and kinds. And we can offer you 10% off or 0% deal and 9 out of 10 times the 0% is just much more compelling, even though it cost the merchants less than 10%. And so just the economics of that trade are so powerful, we will continue leaning into API reductions as a reason to use Affirm products in all sorts of ways, and the card is certainly a giant driver of that.\r\nAnd obviously, there's a bit of a rhyming where if you signed up 3 0% promote, you'd like to see more of those. And so creating more of those in the card is pretty valuable.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nNext question, Andrew Bauch with Wells Fargo.\n\n## Lemar Clarke (Analysts)\nIt's Lemar on for Andrew. On the recent headlines this week around student law enforcement by the administration and the likely wage garnishment, which potentially could affect 5.3 million defaulted student loan borrowers this summer. Are you guys internally thinking about the potential implications for Affirm?\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nIt's something that we're very mindful of. I think we said 2 quarters ago that we have done extensive amount of back testing of presence of student loans, presence of student loan delinquencies in defaults, which is obviously a really important signal. And so all that is already factored into our underwriting, in all the right appropriate ways. And so I can't say we are too concerned. That said, we'll obviously see if there are meaningful changes to repayment as a consequence of the actions of the administration, and we'll adjust appropriately.\n\n## Lemar Clarke (Analysts)\nOkay. Makes sense. And then a quick follow-up. In your prior shareholder letter, you had mentioned work done around the redesign of Affirm app, just focusing on increasing the utility there. And so I wanted to ask you if there's anything that you may be seeing so far in terms of the impact of these changes, maybe in terms of driving conversion and incremental user engagement?\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nIt is improving. I mean we strongly believe in continuous deployment. So a meaningful percentage of the app changes haven't even rolled out yet. We're very careful. The reason for it, by the way, the single most important use of the app, which gets insufficient airplay, from my point of view, is loan repayment. The #1 reason -- the reason we have the app and the #1 reason it's used for is to pay your loan back. So as much as we love tinkering with user interface, the #1 guardrail we run against is -- has our repayment rate changed in a way that we don't like.\r\nAnd so you'll actually see us trickle out quite a number of incremental user interface changes, which every one of them moves some needle somewhere positively on the conversion side of things, always against the backdrop of are we improving or hurting repayment? And if it's ever hurting, those changes don't survive very long. We're very, very careful not to miss with our repayment rates.\r\nThere's some really good stuff coming in the apps, like that's not visible yet. So it's -- I would say ask me this question maybe next quarter, and you'll be able to ask like, hey, you changed this thing and looks cool. If you look through the Affirm Card pre-approval process or loan pre-approval process, you'll see them really need changes towards the end of the flow .That's a good breadcrumb if you wanted to go spelunk some user flows, see what we did. But it did improve conversion rate very nicely.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nNext question, Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\n\n## Ramsey El-Assal (Analysts)\nCould you comment on the online partnership with Costco, that announcement, maybe in terms of impact, timing of the implementation? And then could this move in store at any point? Maybe that's wishful thinking, but I thought I'd ask.\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nLet's see what we can see. It's very cool. I'm very excited about this one. I can say that much. I think it's a brand renowned for its obsession with consumers. It's kind of the original consumer obsessed brand in many ways on the retail side of things. So very, very proud to be a provider to their members.\r\nI don't think we are announcing a time line, but obviously, we wouldn't talk about it if we didn't think that -- I think that will be at some point in a reasonable future, we're definitely not updating any numbers as to its impact on our any metric. These things, as you know, always take a long time to get right. You need to launch, then you need to tune, they you need to do AB test, then you need to make sure it's profitable for all sites involved. So it definitely don't model anything crazy in there. But like every one of our enterprise partnerships, we're very committed to it, which means that over time, we'll fine tune it to be a really great part of our business. So I would just hold your horses a little bit, but we'll invest the right amount of effort into making it great.\n\n## Ramsey El-Assal (Analysts)\nFair enough. A really quick follow-up for me. Any P&L impact from the Shopify renewal? I saw that was impressive that you renewed that through 2020. Was there any concessions on the economic front or any P&L impact we should think through on that renewal?\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nNo economic concessions. The one housekeeping item is that it does elongate the amortization period for the warrants that were -- that Shopify received in the initial agreement. So we just -- because those are tied to the life of the agreement, there is a longer amortization period now, but that's pretty small.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nWill Nance with Goldman Sachs.\n\n## William Nance (Analysts)\nNice results as always. Well, I also wanted to congratulate on Costco partnership, I thought that was great. I was wondering if you could provide any details on sort of your latest understanding about how the Walmart relationship will be evolving over the remainder of the year given some of the headlines out recently?\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nWe're currently live at Walmart. We think we're doing great work. We're actually actively investing in making sure that they are getting the absolute best possible value from our work together. The day we understand when that changes and how we'll obviously notify you and the market. At the moment, I think we are being a good partner and a good vendor. I don't know Rob or Michael want to add any more color? No. I mean we're still proud to power the program, and we're there for Walmart consumers.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nNext question, James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\n\n## James Faucette (Analysts)\nI wanted to go back to the app, interesting comments there, asks about kind of using that to drive and make sure that you have good repayment engagement. But just wondering like then how we should fit that together with some of the promotional and deal offers that come through the app? And I guess, I would expect those to grow. So just help us think about -- I know that there's future improvements coming, but how should we think about the long-term objective of the app. Is it still a repayment engagement mechanism? Or it seems like there's also opportunity to go after kind of your better higher quality customers that you're attracting initially 0%. So just trying to think -- help us think through the long-term scope of the app in that endeavor?\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nSo you should think of the repayment functionality of the app as a key guardrail. In other words, whatever it is we do to the app in pursuit of other goals, we will not compromise repayments. Like this is sort of all consistent with the credit is job #1 thing that I love to repeat. We will never do something that harms repayment because it; one, hurts our capital partners; two, screws up our ability to sign more capital partners, et cetera, et cetera. So that's the guardrail and it's probably -- the reason we don't talk about it is because it's understood, and we will not mess with the repayment.\r\nThat said, the app fundamentally is two more things. It's a catalog of merchants and their offers, most importantly, 0% offers, that are currently available on the network. And it's really important in the sense that consumers do not come to the app to start their shopping journeys. When they do come to the app for in addition to repaying their bills, is to check if a thing or a merchant they're interested in has a great financing offer, be at 0% or a reduced APR or a longer period or increased purchasing power, there's many different kinds of promos that we know how to run, and we know how to run very profitably, both for our partners and for ourselves and delight consumers.\r\nAnd over time, we will send out more reasons to consumers to come to the app to check in on the offers available to them. One of the things that we rolled out within our Adaptive Checkout solution that lives on merchant sites is something that we've built for the app a little while ago, it's called dynamic optimization, which in real time, figures out the best possible terms, by that I mean term length of the loans you might take out, and APR offers for that single consumer given something we know about their current set of interests.\r\nMaybe the best possible approximation for the app, which will sound a little controversial, but actually I think it probably is the best way of -- I read about it, it's a search engine, that you come and query on the topic of I have this thing in mind or I have this merchant in mind, what's the smartest financial decision I can make with Affirm as my tool for -- to fulfill the financial objective. And we expect to lean into answering that question more and more and more. And you can sort of imagine some product ideas and maybe features that come out of that.\r\nThe search engine that we have today is pretty good. We are working on improvements on that pretty relentlessly. I think if I'm allowed a super minor comment on the topic that's not come up yet for which I'm somewhat thankful. If you look at how the world is changing in the context of generative AI, every search is going to be an AI conversation, like that's very, very apparent at this point, you should absolutely expect us to have an answer for that as well.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nMatthew O'Neill with FT Partners.\n\n## Matthew O'Neill (Analysts)\nI was curious if you could give us a little bit of an update on the international expansion, particularly in the U.K. and notably following the partnership with Adyen. Is that something we should expect to be somewhat step functional or maybe just kind of how to dimensionalize that as well as other partnerships like the one with JPMorgan?\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nAdyen, similar to some of the other payment providers or payment processors, the most important value from that partnership, from a kind of partnership really is speed to integration, speed to going live. So it doesn't necessarily increase our pace of sales, but it moves our pace of implementation from whatever average is to shorter because if you already plumbed through with Adyen, you can just light up Affirm in the U.K. very, very quickly. So in the sense that whatever we have in a pipeline that we have signed going live, if they're on Adyen today, will be a faster process. And we have many of those relationships in the U.S. This one isn't the first one internationally, but it's definitely I think the most significant or the most visible one right now.\r\nIn terms of the sense for things in the U.K., just came back from London. I feel like I'm spending half my time in London at this point. Going well, doubling down on sales. I spent a lot of time visiting merchants. Obviously, we are the upstart brand in the market. So I have to spend a lot of time just educating the market about who we are, how we do business, how we're a little bit different from the incumbents.\r\nObviously, we already said out loud, so it's no surprise. The big step function will come when we take Shopify live there, and that's definitely a horizon. We're working towards that. We won't get there before we get through the beta period with Shopify in Canada, which is live now, just a limited number of engineers we can throw at this. But Canada beta is going well. I am confident U.K. beta will happen in a reasonable time and very well as well.\n\n## Matthew O'Neill (Analysts)\nMax, maybe as a follow-up, speaking of large international incumbents. One that had a particularly aggressive posture on AI historically took a bit of a turn today. And I was wondering if you can sort of address where AI is working. I noticed in the note, the dispute resolution process, for example, but maybe where you found the most success, and I know you've been a proponent machine learning in AI for a long time and maybe where the human touch still reigns supreme?\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nThat's a great question. I would -- I can spend a lot of time on it. So we are applying -- and unfortunately, the world has gotten really confused about what is and isn't AI under today's definition versus yesterday's definition. So I'll try to be very precise. So we've used machine learning since the day of our founding. In fact, the idea was to build a credit score that was built on alternative data and modern machine learning techniques. And obviously, we've been pretty successful with it. So we use that all the time, every part of the business, et cetera. So that's just sort of the baseline.\r\nGenAI or LLMs large language models have been really, really helpful in a bunch of places.  Internally, we use them in all kinds of ways, including -- and we're actually quite actively investing into internal adoption of AI, where we have teams that are tasked with finding use cases for GenAI specifically inside their teams or increasing productivity, anything from -- we have literally hundreds of thousands of legal contracts with merchants. You need to find a clause that we need to modify for whatever reason. That's a great task for LLM, read 435,000 contracts or whatever the current number is, find the clause that we need to change, which is very suddenly different contract to contract, summarize it and construct a thing that we need to go out there and get resigned.\r\nSo that's the thing that humans would take thousands of hours for potentially, it can be done in minutes with the AI. And this isn't a made-up example, it's very real.\r\nThe thing that I referred to in the letter, a big part of consumer delight is -- at least for us anyway, is transparency and speed to resolution. And the ability to speak to a human and explain your case is really powerful. That's one thing that I don't think will ever go away, like having empathy from someone who gets it and can actually speak to you with a human emotion in their voice, machines aren't there yet, and it may actually be irreducible.\r\nBut if you kind of know what you want and you don't want to wait and you have it all figured out, most importantly, have the evidence that there's a dispute and it's just going to go a very specific way, and we can use machine learning to adjudicate the outcome, you can package the entire thing with GenAI and say, all right, let's have an interaction. And you understand you're talking to a robot, but this robot can take in all your evidence, process it, run it through machine learning model in the back end and say, yes, this basically means you get a refund. We'll tell you right now, the return is coming, you're going to be okay. We'll take care of the rest. That is a huge booster of customer satisfaction.\r\nAnd so that's actually -- that's what I'm referring to in the letter. That's also an example of both GenAI as a user interface and machine learning on a back end as a resolution device. Machine learning is much more stable, if you will, the models are highly, highly predictable and repeatable. That's why they're favored in precise things like credit underwriting. And GenAI models are somewhat less predictable, everybody has heard about hallucinations, but they make for an amazing, very flexible user interface. And we use both very actively, I'll skip the part where I talk about how we have lots of engineers using lots of AI to write code and so on. But obviously, we're doing that as well.\r\nSo we don't spend a ton of time talking about it. We are very enthusiastic adapters of -- adopters of oldest new stuff, but we also kind of think that it's a bit of a set of tools you use what is available to you and you try to find the very best ones and you maybe don't make such a big story out of it.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nKyle Peterson with Needham & company.\n\n## Kyle Peterson (Analysts)\nCongratulations on the nice results. I wanted to ask a little bit about credit and what you guys are seeing there. Obviously, the delinquency trends look to be pretty healthy. But I noticed you guys did take up the reserve on for loan losses and the balance sheet up a bit sequentially. So was -- is there anything in terms of like concern? Or is there a mix or anything like just, I guess, how should we think about the allowance creeping up? And how should we think about that?\n\n## Robert O'Hare (Executives)\nYes. Thanks for the question. I'll start, and Max may have some color to add as well. We are seeing really healthy repayment rates come through. We do about $100 million of GMV a day. And so we get a pretty fulsome data set every day as those cohorts are coming in for repayment 30 days later. So we're not seeing any signs of stress with the consumer in the repayment rates.\r\nOne small thing that did happen during the quarter is we actually saw a slight uptick in prepayments. And so we take that as a pretty positive credit signal, actually. It is -- there is some tax seasonality, but even adjusting for that, we saw an increase year-on-year in prepayments. So we think that's a modest positive. And that does on the margin change the mix of loans that are still on the balance sheet. And we still feel like the allowance rate, while up marginally is still in a really healthy place. And I think delinquencies are a good leading indicator of where the credit box is and how the book is performing.\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nI just wanted to comment that it's really important to be intellectually honest about credit. Like in the current moment, the snapshot looks fantastic. Things could change. We are very attentive. We will change with things. The good news or the most important property of our business, we have a very, very short term length. And so as the book goes through, we adjust our required credit quality on the front book as the back book mixes out, and we will always get to the numbers that we need to have for us and for our capital partners.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nVincent Caintic with BTIG.\n\n## Vincent Caintic (Analysts)\nI wanted to get an update on two topics. I'll just ask both of them now. So the first one about competition. So kind of related to that discussion earlier related to Walmart. In this environment where maybe you have competition willing to give back economics to win merchants. Just wondering if you're seeing a lot of that sort of competition?\r\nAnd then second, update, if you could talk about your funding structure. And actually, specifically, if you had any updated thoughts about becoming a bank. And the reason I ask is it does seem like the regulatory environment is more conducive to becoming a bank, whether it's build or buy. So just wanted to see if there's any updated thoughts there.\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nI'm going to make Michael answer the competition question because I feel like I've been completely monopolizing airtime, but I'll answer the bank question first.\r\nThere are three distinct things having to do with bank charters. Number one, that really does not apply here, and it's important to just get that out of the way. Even if we woke up tomorrow morning with a bank charter in our back pocket, we would not be able to lend from deposits that, that bank had. It would take a long time to gather deposits. It would be regulatorily encumbered in what's called de novo period where you really wouldn't be able to do all that much at all with it. And so it's -- a bank charter is just not a solution for our funding strategy. That's sort of full stop.\r\nAnd if we had a bank charter tomorrow, 5 years from now, we can have a conversation about what is that doing for your funding cost and even then probably not. So that's not a thing.\r\nThere are two other things. There's regulatory certainty where if you have your own charter, you can have a little bit more clarity as to how the regulators think of you, the bank partner model gets interrogated by the regulators, both federal and state level fairly frequently. We have done really well. It obviously doesn't hurt that we look our bank partner -- make our bank partners look good by not charging any late fees, by not doing any questionable anti-consumer things. So our partnerships have been strong, and we've enjoyed a plurality of bank partnerships over the years. That's said, there's some argument to be had there.\r\nThe most important thing, and I said it before and I'll say it again, we are regulatorily driven or motivated towards features or by features. In other words, if there were a feature that we just couldn't build without a bank charter, we would absolutely consider pursuing one. And there is a handful of those. There's no point in sort of rattling them off, but you could construct a straw man around. You would want to do this because it's great for consumers, it's on mission. Affirm would be good at it, and yet you can't because there's no bank charter. If and when we prioritize one of those things, bank charter will become part of the consideration.\r\nAnd that's where -- we've been in that mode for quite some time, and you're totally right that the current regulators, I think, have publicly called for wanting to see more applications. So it's not lost on us, but we would do it if we felt the need to pursue it for a product construct that we had in mind.\r\nMichael, now on competition.\n\n## Michael Linford (Executives)\nYes. Look, on competition, the first thing I'd say is it's very competitive today as it's been since the day we went public. The category will, we believe, remain competitive well into the future, anytime a category is being defined like ours where there's meaningful adoption of a new category. It attracts competition from pure players, but also attract competition from the comments in the broader consumer credit space, who would like to compete. That has been true for the past 5 years. We include in our supplement, a chart that shows the trends of our merchant fee rates over the past 5 years -- over the past several years, sorry.\r\nAnd it's -- the thing that jumps out to me and hopefully to investors is how consistent our pricing has been despite the extreme competitive environment. And the reason why is we don't win on price. We obviously have to put forward competitive pricing and our cost structure and ability to do things that we do in the capital markets allows us to be aggressive. But it's really important given the risk management mindset that we have in our business that we can generate enough profit to operate the business the way we want to operate it, which means we don't do the same thing that some competition might do with respect to pricing.\r\nWe win on conversion, we win on impact. We win on putting ourselves out there for the consumers of the brands that we work with. And I think the track record we have on our distribution is evidence of that. And I think the more successful we are improving, there's a really good business to be had here, the more competition it will attract. We've never thought about our contracts or our distribution as being something that cements our leadership. We have to earn it every day by driving real impact for our merchant partners. And that's where our focus certainly lies. But make no mistake, we think the market is competitive and will remain competitive for as long as we're out changing the world.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nNext question, David Scharf with Citizens Capital Markets.\n\n## David Scharf (Analysts)\nMax, I just wanted to circle back to the 0% loan focus in mix. I appreciate the commentary that it's been more reactive to what partners are asking for as opposed to proactive. I guess the main question I have is, maybe you can give us a little more color on just why? I mean, what do we generally take away in periods where you see particularly some of the larger enterprise partners want to lean into it. Is it a statement about what they're seeing on retail sales and worries and concerns trying to drive more volume? Is it competitive in terms of playing you off of, let's say, another competitor. What should we basically take away from kind of this uptick in interest in promotional activity?\n\n## Michael Linford (Executives)\nLet me try to maybe add a little color here. I think it's important to think about the state and condition of our merchant partners when you think about these kind of programs. And in our experience, merchants who are wanting to do 0% promotions tend to be the ones who are most growth-oriented. It's a reflection of strength in those merchants where they really want to go out and be front-footed and grow their businesses. It's an incredibly powerful growth tool for them.\r\nI think the truth is when we were dealing with a surge in rates and associated pressures to the merchant partners, it became very difficult to make the economics work for these. But when you're in a scenario that we were most of this quarter and certainly the prior couple of quarters where the market conditions were favorable for the provider and Affirm and the brands really wanted to invest dollars in growth, it's a great lever to pull. Where I think merchants pull back on 0s is when they feel like they need to be less growthful and more focused on the cost structure of the business. And so I've always thought about it as a real sign of strength for the merchants, knowing that, that's a great way for them to grow their business. There's nothing defensive about that.\r\nThe last thing to note is really important. Our merchant partners are reactive. I think they're some of the best retailers in the world. But even with that, they don't react in minutes and days. These things take months to think about and plan and execute. And as a result, I think it would be a big mistake to look at what we saw this quarter and associated with anything you're reading in the news.\n\n## Robert O'Hare (Executives)\nYes. And I would just add to what Michael said. Some of the largest merchants that chose to run 0 this quarter really have business models where they're both selling direct to consumer and then they're also selling into a distribution channel. And when you look at the unit level economics for that merchant, selling direct is the most profitable action they can do. And so while the MDRs that they're paying to Affirm might be higher than credit card processing rate that they're paying on the direct channel, if they can drive more volume through direct, it's still really accretive to their gross margins versus selling into wholesale or selling into a channel.\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nThat's really, really important. I just want to underline what Rob just said, that is like a very, very key thing to understand about the business.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nNext question, Giuliano Bologna with Compass Point.\n\n## Giuliano Anderes-Bologna (Analysts)\nCongrats on continued incredible results. One thing I was curious about asking you was when I look at the outlook, it kind of implies a continued acceleration in GMV growth. And I'm curious to ask you if there's any -- if you have any sense of any potential pull forward that may or may not have happened, related to the whole tariff discussion, Liberation Day? And how you think about that because you probably have a lot more insight being a month plus beyond that. And I'm curious how you think about that and when you think about the outlook for the rest of the year, what that implies for GMV growth acceleration?\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nYes. Thanks for the question. So I think at the high end of the GMV range, we're calling for 34% year-on-year growth, and that's down ever so slightly from the 36% growth that we saw this quarter. So we're not calling for an acceleration on that basis in the guide. And then we alluded to it in the letter, but we did see elevated growth rates in April, those were roughly in line with what we saw in March, which we had called out as 40% year-on-year growth in the month. So we are expecting that growth will moderate from the levels that we've seen quarter to date.\n\n## Giuliano Anderes-Bologna (Analysts)\nThat's very helpful. And then you obviously have a pretty incredible funding structure. But when you think about the percent of loans that you might sell on a quarter-to-quarter basis, should we think about that running at the high end of the historical range for a while in the near future? Or just because of the volume of partnerships that are out there and the demand for private credit? And just how that should flow through at least in the near term?\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nI mean I think when you think about the funding mix, the biggest variable in any given quarter is whether or not we're going to do a nonconsolidated ABS deal. We did just price a nonconsolidated ABS deal last week. And so that will have an impact on the mix of off-balance sheet funding that we see intra-quarter, but we've also had really strong execution with on-balance sheet ABS too. So -- and we're fortunate to have really great funding partners in all of our channels, forward flow included. So yes, I think there will be a modest uptick in off-balance sheet funding as a result of the ABS deal that we did. But otherwise, we really haven't commented on funding mix.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nNext question, Reggie Smith with JPMorgan.\n\n## Reginald Smith (Analysts)\nI've got, I guess, one more, and I hate to beat a dead horse, but I have a question about the 0 coupon offers. I'm specifically interested in the ones where you guys are doing the funding. I was hoping you could share -- typically, when I think about those 0 financing, my mind always goes back to kind of the Peloton bites. And I'm guessing that's not either the price point or the duration for those loans. So maybe if you could talk a little bit about those loans, in particular, the 0 coupon loans that you guys are financing yourselves. And then again, just reading the note, it sounds like those are primarily showing up in your app. Maybe talk about where, like, how you're deploying them a little bit?\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nYes, Reggie, to your question, about 10% of the 0% volume would come on, what I would consider our surfaces, either the Affirm Card is the best example and the largest example in the quarter, but also some of the wallet partnerships, right? We can dictate what the financing program is there, and we're not -- there's not a merchant necessarily that's part of the equation in that function.\r\nSo those are the two best examples. Again, that was only about 10% of the 0% volume, and we can dictate the exact cutoffs for when the 0% is presented, and we can filter there either based on the credit quality of the consumers. It may be obvious that I'll say it anyway, higher credit quality consumers, there typically are lower costs for us elsewhere in the transaction. And so we can lean in by foregoing some of the interest revenue that we would get in an interest-bearing loan and present more 0s as a result.\r\nBut yes, that's really how we're thinking about it. I mean, we do -- we've typically had some 0% in all of our own services, card, again, is the best example. And we can play with the mix of 0s that we want to run in any given quarter and be thoughtful about the consumers we present 0s to and when and why.\n\n## Reginald Smith (Analysts)\nGot it. So it sounds like for those 0s, in particular, those are people that you know, they already have the card. It's almost like a reward to them as opposed to in the case of you self-funding, those aren't you like acquiring new customers, it is primarily people that you already know?\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nThat's right. And again, I want to make sure we address the self-funding piece because when we look at the top 20 merchants that drove 0% volume, I mean those are mostly negotiated 0% programs where there's a healthy MDR to cover the costs. And to the Peloton point that you raised, Peloton was obviously a very long-dated loan program, and it had a very, very high percentage of 0% loans. And so it's all together just a different equation. The 0s that we saw this quarter clustered around roughly 12 months in term length. And so the MDR that we need to make the math work there is just -- it's different than a 3-year loan program like we had with Peloton...\n\n## Michael Linford (Executives)\nMaybe just to extent, I think we're making -- I think we have maybe, we talk about self-funding these things a little bit too much. It's not a binary thing. Is it Affirm funded or not. We look at the merchant fees that we get either through the merchant discount rate and a negotiated deal or the interchange on the card, including Visa flexible credential interchange, and we make a financing offer based upon that revenue mix. There's always revenue in the picture. When we talk about self-funding, what we mean is that we can intentionally direct a higher mix of offers to that consumer. And maybe that means we're intentionally accepting slightly lower margin. But we're not walking into situations and saying, let's go acquire users by offering 24 months 0% promotional financing. That's just not the business model.\n\n## Max Levchin (Executives)\nYes. And again, we try to be really transparent with the merchant discount rates that we collect by product. And you can see the consistency that we've driven there across each of the product lines in the earnings supplement.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nNext final question comes from Jeff with Seaport Research.\n\n## Jeffrey Cantwell (Analysts)\nMost of my questions been asked, I just have a quick one maybe for Rob, which is how are you thinking about that sales and marketing line going forward? It looks like it stepped down this quarter, $74 million. Just trying to get a sense of, a, what got into that number this quarter? And b, what the right level is for your sales and marketing? And maybe just touch on qualitatively, any initiatives that are worth calling out?\n\n## Robert O'Hare (Executives)\nYes. I think the biggest change there was just that the amortization of warrant expense from one of our large partners came to the end of its amortization period in the December quarter. And so this was the first quarter without that expense flowing through that line. So a step down in the noncash warrant amortization and that will be the case going into this current June quarter as well. That was the biggest change.\n\n## Jeffrey Cantwell (Analysts)\nGot it. And so that flows through going forward? Or how should we think about that? I'm just trying to get a sense of the...\n\n## Robert O'Hare (Executives)\nThe amortization period has ended there. So the run rate that you saw this quarter will be roughly what you should expect in the June quarter.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nI would like to turn the floor over to Zane for closing remarks.\n\n## Zane Keller (Executives)\nOkay. Thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nThis concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.\n",

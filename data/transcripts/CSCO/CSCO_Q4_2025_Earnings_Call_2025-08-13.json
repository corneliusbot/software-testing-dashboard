      "text": "Thanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We had a strong close to fiscal '25, delivering revenue and gross margin at the high end of our guidance ranges for the fourth quarter. Continued operating leverage across our business produced strong profitability with earnings per share above the high end of our guidance. In addition, we generated solid growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations and subscription revenue, which provides a strong foundation for our future performance.\r\nThe profitable growth of our business continues to produce strong cash flows, supporting our commitment to deliver consistent capital returns. In Q4, we returned $2.9 billion in capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends bringing the total return in fiscal '25 to $12.4 billion in value or 94% of free cash flow, surpassing the $12.1 billion Cisco returned to shareholders in fiscal '24. Overall, our FY '25 performance has established a solid foundation as we turn our focus to delivering Cisco's strongest year yet in fiscal year '26 as indicated in our guidance.\r\nAs we move into the next phase of AI with agents autonomously conducting tasks alongside humans, the capacity requirements of the network will be compounded to accommodate both unprecedented levels of network traffic and an increasing threat landscape. According to our survey of IT networking leaders, 97% of businesses believe they need to upgrade their networks to successfully deploy AI.\r\nHaving refreshed almost our entire product portfolio with industry-leading networking systems powered by Silicon One, AI native security solutions and software operating systems, Cisco is well positioned to provide the critical infrastructure needed for the AI era.\r\nNow let me comment on the demand we saw in Q4, starting with record AI infrastructure orders received from webscale customers. These orders exceeded $800 million in the quarter, bringing the total for fiscal year '25 to over $2 billion, more than double our original $1 billion target stated in Q4 of fiscal year '24. This demonstrates the undeniable capability and relevance of our technology for multiple back-end use cases with some of the most technologically advanced customers.\r\nOverall, total product orders in Q4 grew 7% year-over-year with solid growth across all geographies despite a complex environment, demonstrating the valuable outcomes we continue to deliver for customers worldwide. Enterprise product orders were up 5% year-over-year in Q4. As typical for the fourth quarter, we closed several very large deals with major enterprises across different industries who are compounding the value of their investments by leveraging the full breadth of our technology platforms.\r\nWe have a slide in our earnings presentation that highlights both the breadth of Cisco's reach through 8-figure or larger deals and the versatility of solutions tailored to our customers' needs. Public sector orders were down 6% year-over-year in Q4 compared with a very strong fourth quarter in FY '24 when orders grew double digits year-over-year. That said, overall public sector demand grew sequentially in line with normal seasonality. Product orders from service provider and cloud customers continue to be very strong, up 49% year-over-year, driven by triple-digit order growth in webscale for the fourth consecutive quarter, with 4 out of the top 6 webscale customers each growing orders in the triple digits.\r\nIn fact, two webscale customers each placed total orders of over $1 billion for networking, security, collaboration and observability in FY '25. Demand from telco and cable customers was also strong in Q4 with orders growing more than 20% year-over-year. Now some color on demand for our core networking and security solutions. Networking product orders grew double digits in Q4, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, driven by webscale infrastructure, switching, enterprise routing, industrial IoT and servers.\r\nThere is strong interest from customers in the new family of Cisco Cat9k smart switches along with a completely refreshed lineup of highly secure routers, wireless access points and industrial IoT devices, which are purpose-built for the AI-ready campus and branch. Our new smart switches are powered by Silicon One and deliver enhanced performance, quantum secure networking and radically simplified cloud-native and AI-driven operations, all supporting the new realities as AI changes how we work and collaborate.\r\nThe introduction of our new switches marks the beginning of a major multiyear refresh cycle opportunity for Cisco's large installed campus switching base. Orders for our industrial IoT portfolio comprised of ruggedized catalyst products grew double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter, and we see solid demand signals continuing into FY '26, as countries around the world are committing to U.S. domestic investments as part of their trade agreements.\r\nAs more strategic infrastructure and manufacturing is brought onshore to the United States, Cisco is well positioned to help connect and protect these capital-intensive investments at scale. As I mentioned earlier, the AI infrastructure orders we received from webscale customers were once again exceptionally strong, exceeding $800 million in the quarter. As expected, the product mix of these orders was more than 2/3 in Systems with the remainder in Optics.\r\nIn the enterprise specifically, while still early, AI orders are ramping and we have a growing pipeline in the hundreds of millions as these customers look to Cisco to provide simple, scalable and secure solutions for the AI era. Our expanding partnership with NVIDIA also positions us to deliver on these new demands with completed integrations of Cisco Nexus switches with NVIDIA's Spectrum-X architecture, offering low latency, high-speed networking for AI clusters.\r\nAdditionally, the Cisco Secure AI factory with NVIDIA provides a trusted blueprint for building secure AI-ready data centers for enterprises, sovereign cloud providers and newly emerging Neocloud providers. \r\nWe also see the opportunity with Neocloud providers ramping with several large deals in Q4, not included in the previously mentioned AI infrastructure orders. Our newly forged Middle East strategic partnerships, including HUMAIN, G42 and Stargate UAE, are all progressing as planned, and we expect the sovereign AI opportunity to build momentum in the second half of fiscal year '26. We believe Cisco will be a core system provider for these significant AI training and inference cluster build-outs and integral to their development and eventual hyperscaling. \r\nAs we look holistically at the AI opportunity for Cisco, we frame it into three distinct but connected pillars. First, AI training infrastructure for webscale customers. Combinations of our Cisco 8K, Silicon One, optics and optical systems are being deployed by the largest web scalers, and we expect demand for these technologies from Neocloud providers and sovereign customers to increase in fiscal year '26. \r\nSecond, AI inference and enterprise clouds. Our accelerated innovation in hardware and software, coupled with our NVIDIA partnership, is designed to simplify, accelerate and derisk AI infrastructure deployments for the enterprise. \r\nAnd third, AI network connectivity. Customers are leveraging Cisco platforms to help modernize, secure and automate their network operations to prepare for pervasive deployment of AI agents and applications. As we move towards Agentic AI and the demand for inferencing expands to the enterprise and end-user networking environments, traffic on the network will reach unprecedented levels.  \r\nNetwork traffic will not only increase beyond the peaks of current chatbot interaction, but will remain consistently high with agents in constant interaction. We have a slide illustrating this new traffic model in our earnings presentation available on our website.\r\nAs agents gain autonomous decision-making and action capabilities, security will be even more critical to ensure they operate reliably and safely. As a trusted partner for enterprises, hyperscalers, Neocloud and sovereign cloud providers alike, Cisco has the opportunity to lead this generational transition in networking and security and provide the critical infrastructure needed for the AI era.  \r\nNow shifting to security. We recorded mid-single-digit growth in orders in Q4. Splunk and Cisco synergies delivered a 14% year-over-year increase in new logos for Splunk in Q4, demonstrating the benefit of our cross-selling motions and joint innovation. Our new and refreshed products, including Secure Access, XDR, Hypershield and AI Defense, also continue to ramp and added 750 new customers collectively in the quarter. The vast majority of our new Hypershield enterprise customers are bundling with our N9300 smart switch which enables them to embed security directly into the fabric of the network.\r\nWe believe that Agentic AI can only be secured by fusing security deep into the network and that only Cisco can deliver this capability. Now I'd like to comment on our accelerating innovation pipeline. At Cisco Live U.S. in June, we delivered our largest innovation payload to date, announcing over 20 new customer-centric offerings across our portfolio to help our customers build AI-ready data centers and future-proof their workplaces with a foundational layer of digital resilience.\r\nYou can see the full list of product launches in our slide deck, but I'd like to highlight our AgenticOps, which are already resonating with customers. Cisco AI Canvas is a revolutionary generative user interface for real-time collaboration between network and security teams, optimized for both human and agent interaction. Powered by Cisco's advanced deep network model LLM, AI Canvas unifies real-time telemetry across various platforms to radically simplify IT operations and accelerate troubleshooting.\r\nAll of our new innovations introduced in FY '25, spanning core networking products based on Cisco Silicon One, advanced security technologies and unified management tools are designed on the foundation of AI further enhancing Cisco's platform advantage, where every technology doesn't just add value by itself, but compounds the value of our customers' existing investments.\r\nWe continue to use GenAI and Agentic systems across our customer experience organization with things like services as code and AI agents for in-product support, renewals and adoption. Today, over 2/3 of support cases are touched by AI and automation, which increases the proportion of complex cases we can solve within one day. We're also seeing increased usage of Cisco's own proprietary AI application internally with more advanced use cases emerging across engineering, sales, operations and our people policy and purpose organization, resulting in meaningful productivity gains for our teams.\r\nTo summarize, we are seeing clear demand for our technology across customer markets in addition to expanded opportunities as we move towards Agentic AI. We are innovating faster than ever before, making AI foundational in our designs, fusing security deep into our networking products and providing operational simplicity for our customers. And our strong performance is fueling our capital allocation model, returning significant value to our shareholders, while positioning our business for success in fiscal '26.\r\nBefore I close, I'd like to once again thank Scott Herren for his leadership and partnership over the last 5 years. Scott has been instrumental in driving our transition to more software and recurring revenue, which has driven greater predictability for our business and increased shareholder value. We wish you all the best in your retirement. I'd also like to take a moment to thank our teams for their hard work to close out the year for executing with urgency as One Cisco and most importantly, for their unfailing focus on delivering valuable outcomes for our customers.\r\nNow I'll turn it over to Mark for more detail on the quarter and our outlook."

      "text": "Thanks, Chuck. We delivered a strong quarter with revenue and non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin at the high end of our guidance range and earnings per share above the high end of our guidance, coupled with solid operating cash flow. For the quarter, total revenue was $14.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $4 billion, up 12% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.99, up 14%, demonstrating good operating leverage with EPS growth outpacing revenue growth.\r\nBefore we dive into the details, it's worth reiterating as a reminder that we had a full 13-week contribution from Splunk in Q4 FY '24 last year. So our reported year-over-year growth rates are fully comparable this quarter. Looking at our Q4 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $10.9 billion, up 10%. Services revenue was $3.8 billion, flat year-over-year. Networking was up 12%, with growth across most of the portfolio, led by double-digit growth in Internet infrastructure and enterprise routing as well as solid growth in switching, partially offset by a decline in servers.\r\nSecurity was up 9%, primarily driven by growth in our offerings from Splunk and SASE. Collaboration was up 2%, driven by solid growth in devices. Observability was up 4%, led by strong growth in Splunk and ThousandEyes. Looking at our recurring metrics. Total RPO was $43.5 billion, up 6%, Product RPO grew 8%, and total short-term RPO was $21.7 billion, up 4%.\r\nTotal ARR ended the quarter at $31.1 billion, an increase of 5% with product ARR growth of 8%. Total subscription revenue increased 3% to $7.9 billion and represents 54% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 5% at $5.6 billion, with software subscription revenue also up 5%. Q4 product orders were up 7% year-over-year. Looking at our product orders across geographic segments. The Americas was up 5%. EMEA was up 10%, and APJC was up 7%. In our customer markets, service provider and cloud was up 49%. Enterprise was up 5% and public sector was down 6%.\r\nTotal non-GAAP gross margin came in at 68.4%, up 50 basis points year-over-year, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 67.5%, up 50 basis points, driven by productivity improvements. Non-GAAP services gross margin was 70.8%, also up 50 basis points.\r\nOur total gross margin included a small impact from tariffs, which was slightly favorable compared to our estimate that was included in our guidance. We continue our focus on profitability and financial discipline with non-GAAP operating margin of 34.3% at the high end of our guidance range.\r\nOur non-GAAP tax rate was 18.1% for the quarter. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $16.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $4.2 billion, up 14%, primarily driven by our revenue and earnings growth. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders during the quarter comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of our share repurchases with $14.2 billion now remaining under our share repurchase program.\r\nTurning to the full fiscal year. Revenue was $56.7 billion, up 5%. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 68.7%, up 120 basis points. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $15.2 billion, flat year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.81, which was up 2%. Operating cash flow was $14.2 billion, up 30% compared to FY '24.\r\nCash flow growth from the full year was positively impacted by some large tax payments in early FY '24 that did not repeat in FY '25. We returned $12.4 billion in value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. This was comprised of $6.4 billion in quarterly cash dividends and $6 billion of share repurchases. We increased our dividend for the 14th consecutive year in FY '25, reinforcing our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows.\r\nTo summarize, we had a solid fiscal quarter and year with top and bottom line performance, meeting and exceeding our expectations, driven by strong order growth and margins. For the full fiscal 2025, we delivered record non-GAAP operating income and margin, demonstrating our ability to provide operating leverage, while driving strong top line growth. We remain focused on making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities we see ahead. This will continue to be underpinned by disciplined spend management. And it's this powerful combination that continues to fuel strong cash flow and our ability to return significant value to our shareholders.\r\nTurning to guidance. While we have some clarity on tariffs, we are still operating in a complex environment. Our Q1 and fiscal year 2026 guide assumes current tariffs and exemptions remain in place through the end of fiscal 2026. These include the following: China at 30%, partially offset by an exemption for semiconductors and certain electronic components; Mexico at 25% and; Canada at 35% for the components and products that are not eligible for the current USMCA exemptions. \r\nOther countries reverted to country-specific reciprocal rates, but largely offset by an exemption for semiconductors and certain electronic components.  \r\nAnd finally, a small impact from tariffs on copper, steel and aluminum and retaliatory tariffs. We will continue to leverage our world-class supply chain team to help mitigate the impact of tariffs where appropriate. Through the flexibility and agility we have built into our operations over the last few years, the size and scale of our supply chain provides us with some unique advantages as we support our customers globally. \r\nLooking ahead, you can expect us to continue our focus on durable growth with financial discipline in driving operating leverage and continued capital returns. Our fiscal Q1 guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $14.65 billion to $14.85 billion; we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 67.5% to 68.5%; non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34%; non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.97 to $0.99. We are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%.\r\nFor fiscal year '26, our guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $59 billion to $60 billion; non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range from $4 to $4.06. \r\nSami, let's now move into the Q&A."

      "text": "I guess my first question is, looking at your guidance and given the commentary around the AI opportunity and reflective of sovereign starting to kick in into the second half of the fiscal year, just kind of taking the midpoint, it would seem to assume you've got some deceleration of growth from, call it, 6.5%, 7%.\r\nWe guided for fiscal first quarter to about 4.5% going into the remaining 3 quarters. I'm curious, does that reflect conservatism? Is there any change in the demand environment that you're factoring in? I'm just -- I'm kind of curious how we bridge maybe that deceleration through the remaining quarters of the fiscal year."

So let me just say that the AI opportunity is clearly one that we have been pleased with our execution on -- and as we look out -- I think the dynamic that you're talking about is strictly connected to just year-over-year comps later in the year. I don't think it's got -- it hasn't -- it's not meant to signal any change in demand or anything that we think.\r\nI think one of the questions that I expect is does the campus refresh begin to kick in? And should that be a big revenue driver next fiscal year? And if you think about the campus the Cat9k is in year 8 of this transition. So it's -- and lots of customers will take a lot of time to evaluate that and look at those products before they begin to deploy them. So we think that's going to kick in next year as well. And we're pleased with the progress we made on AI. But I think the annual progression is really related to comps. Mark, do you have anything to add?"

      "text": "All right. Why don't I cover security and Mark, you can obviously cover CFO priorities. Meta, thanks for the questions. I would say that I am more optimistic about security coming out of the last quarter, and I'll tell you why. Last quarter, I explained to all of you that we really have two sets of products. We have the set that is new and refreshed and that's the SASE, XDR, Hypershield, AI Defense as well as our refreshed firewall portfolio. And then we have the area of older products that are not huge investment areas for us, right now are kind of the long tail of the life cycle.\r\nIf you look at those new products and new and refreshed, again, including our refreshed firewalls, we saw order growth during the quarter in excess of 20%. So they continue to have widespread adoption. But perhaps the metric that I think will give you more confidence here is, if you take out U.S. Federal, which had a tough year as we all know, rest of world security order growth in Q4 was up double digits.\r\nSo we're really -- we're seeing this ramp, and I told -- I think I said on the last call, it's happening slower than I had anticipated. A lot of it is because the stuff is ratable. But I feel good about where we are. We have 80 new Hypershield customers largely connected to this new smart switch, so that strategy is working. And I would say that we had 480-plus new SSE customers during the quarter. So that's -- our Secure Services Edge is really getting good traction. \r\nAnd what I would say is based on how we see this stuff evolving, I would see the growth rate continuing to improve as we get through the fiscal year this year. So that's the story on security. Mark, do you want to take the second question?"

I've been with the company now 25 years in a variety of roles and responsibilities. And I think as I look ahead, we have significant opportunity, whether it's in AI infrastructure, in the webscale space, now in the nascent, but growing enterprise AI opportunity. Obviously, Neoclouds and the sovereign AI build-out happening.\r\nAlso, you look to cybersecurity and how we've improved our hand there with Splunk and then the campus refresh that we've got ahead of us, which will be multiyear. I think we've got great opportunity. And what I really want to do is make sure that we're funded for success. And we're looking at those opportunities for what do we need to do to be successful. I also think in terms of expectations of me, you can expect that I will be focused on durable, profitable growth, obviously, financial discipline and transparency and really just returning value to the shareholders."

And in Q3 and Q4, we had over 300 new logos for Splunk new customers that bought Splunk for the first time. So that strategy seems to be working. The teams are doing really good job there, which is another reason I have confidence in the security strategy this year."

And I haven't heard one instance in the last 6 months of a single customer who said, \"I'm going to order this now before price increases occur.\" Not that we're increasing prices, we haven't announced anything like that.

So one of the things we look at is really that time from shipment to activation and to see if that is stretched out at all. It did not as well. We also look at ship dates requested from customers.\r\nAnd if those are sliding, then that might be an indication that they don't really want the gear yet, but they wanted to get an order in early, didn't see any issue there either.

Maybe, Chuck, if I can sort of ask you more on the networking cycle here, particularly that there was a period of time that you went through a digestion with customers and then you started to see the recovery in the networking cycle.\r\nThere's been 2 quarters of solid growth on that front. As you think about next year or fiscal '26, how do you sort of see that growth sustaining, particularly if we sort of put aside the new upgrades in relation to Cat9k upgrades that you're looking at like where are customers in terms of their intent to upgrade legacy infrastructure? And basically, what I'm trying to get to is at the Investor Day, you had talked about 2% to 5% being the range of networking through the medium term. And where do you think you land on that front in fiscal '26."

And if you think about the AI revolution, what we are seeing, and we've seen this with transitions over the last decade or so that we tend to see these things begin first in the cloud providers, which we're clearly seeing the AI play in the cloud providers, then we see it shift into the enterprise. Well, we see it shift in the back -- end in this case, from the back end to the front end, we believe that will occur as enterprises start using more of these services.\r\nAnd then enterprises will also build out inferencing as we know, on-prem in addition to that. And we're even seeing the telco business actually pick up as they're actually telling us they're increasing their network capacity and they're modernizing their infrastructure in preparation for AI. So we think that AI is going to drive network modernization across all of these segments. And then you have the campus upgrade, which we really haven't started yet. And if you think about what the comment I made earlier, we've got routing refresh. We've got a lot of new technology in our data center networking business, which, by the way, grew mid-teens orders last fiscal year in the enterprise.\r\nWe have WiFi 7, which grew triple digits year-over-year. So we're seeing good uptake there and we got the new campus products. But the new campus switching, again, we're in year 8 of the Cat9k. And honestly, if you look at products that were pre Cat9k that are still installed in our customer base, there's tens of billions of dollars of installed base that's there that we can go after. So we think that all of that leads us to feel very confident about maintaining the range that we provided at Analyst Day on core networking."

So I just want to make sure everybody understands our webscale business. First of all, we sell technology into the back end. We sell technology into the front end or the traditional cloud networks, and we sell our enterprise portfolio to these customers as well. And if you look at our entire portfolio, these customers in aggregate grew triple digits 4 quarters in a row from an orders perspective.\r\nWe had four of them that grew triple digit in Q4 by themselves. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we had two of these customers across the portfolio that placed orders in excess of $1 billion each in fiscal year '25. So if you think back 5 years ago, we were talking about our strategy in this space, this was definitely not the case. So we feel good about the progress we made. And then I think you understood on the AI infrastructure, we had greater than $800 million in orders during the quarter and we have greater than $2 billion on the year, more than double our original target.

I think in our remarks we talked about earlier, they're about half and half. And we saw a few hundred million dollars that move through, and we have hundreds of millions in the pipeline right now for enterprise.\r\nI'd say that there's a lot of pilots going. There's a lot of work going on with customers who are piloting different applications in retail environments, et cetera. So we think it will start to ramp. And then we think that you'll see AI applications ramp. And in the second half of the year, we think you're going to see Agentic proof-of-concepts become more, I'd say, pervasive and that's going to require, obviously, network connectivity, network capacity, low latency and candidly, you're going to -- we're going to have to put security into the fabric of the network because, as we talked about earlier, these Agentic workflows, they're going to be in constant communication, whether you think about general agents or you think about robotics, you're going to -- the importance of the low latency connectivity is going to be huge and the security is going to be huge.\r\nAnd the only way to do both of those is defuse security into the core of the network. So that's our plan. That's why we're working so hard on what we're working on. In the NVIDIA space, I'd say a lot of the development is going on. I would just say we -- I don't believe we've seen the meaningful benefit of that partnership yet, and we've got some good development that's been completed. We got a lot of milestones that are going to be done in the next few months. And we think that as the enterprise really begins to ramp up that partnership and our portfolio, we think we'll be in good shape to help them out.\r\nOn the revenue contribution from fiscal year '26 relative to AI, I would just say that we don't really guide by specific parts of the technology. But given that we had $1 billion in FY '25, you can probably extrapolate out what you think we'll do in '26 because we got the backlog, and we have the new orders that we take down during the year."

And if you look at the trend line over the last 5 quarters, the growth decelerated from 6.5% to 5.5% to 2.5%, now 0%.  What are the trends in service revenues? And what should we expect going forward? That's question number one. \r\nAnd question number two is the networking growth, it's driven by spending of -- spending in investments by cloud. How much risk is there that this year is a phenomenal year for spending and trends would slow down next year just because Oracle is not going to grow again another 150% and Meta is not going to grow again another 70%, 80%, et cetera.

So on the services, if you go back a year ago and even a little bit longer ago, you saw a lot of professional services that we did, really helping our customers and our partners, frankly, working hand-in-hand to implement a lot of that gear that we had shipped.\r\nIf you remember, all that excess backlog that we sort of unloaded on our customers, if you will, we were helping do that. So that drove nice growth in our services business for a while. What we usually do see, as you know, as services usually trails or sort of follows on to what's happening in product, for instance. So as we saw networking growth of 12% this quarter, I would expect that you'll start to see services pick up as revenue on services is ratable.

And Agentic, the refreshed identity portfolio. We saw that growing in excess of 20%.

So to answer your question directly, number one, I don't think we should change those ranges. Number two, do I believe we'll exit the year at it? I think we're going to exit the year either near it or on a path to get there pretty soon after that. That's first. \r\nOn the HUMAIN and on the sovereign side, we are working very closely with AMD on a couple of those, and you should assume that we will have a very, very tight partnership with them as well so that we're -- primarily so that we can deliver highly integrated solutions to these customers as we work with them going forward.

If you know -- if you take out federal, the rest of the world grew at 10%.

So I think on the back-end side, as I've said before, the two -- in the networking side, the two areas where the value is really derived is either in the silicon or in the software. And so given that many of these folks are using a lot of their own operating systems, you have to have silicon deploy in the first place. So the good news is we do. Then when you look at this scale-up opportunity in the back end and the hyperscalers in many -- in most cases, they're not using the clusters with the scale up inside the cluster.\r\nThey're using native connectivity within the clusters and then between clusters. And we think there that, that probably remains the predominant play. We're seeing the desire for some of these clusters in Neocloud, et cetera, because they're easy, but there's still a connectivity layer, obviously, between the clusters. From a scale-up perspective, we think over time, that opportunity could shift to more of an Ethernet variant, which would give us obviously an easy way to play.\r\nWe've got road maps that we're working on that haven't been announced yet, but I think downstream, if that occurs, we could definitely play in that space. On the Meraki Catalyst question, I actually think the opposite is actually -- what you would see is you'd see more openness to catalysts because of the cloud management, the simple cloud management. I think there's 35 million devices now being managed by the cloud. And so it just gives customers choice. It rationalizes the hardware down to a single platform that you can run in either mode. You can run it on-prem or you can run it cloud managed, and I think that's a big benefit for our customers as we go forward."

  "text": "# Cisco Systems, Inc. - Q4 2025 Earnings Call\nDate: 2025-08-13T20:30:00Z\nType: Earnings Calls\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nWelcome to Cisco's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations.\n\n## Ahmed Sami Badri (Executives)\nGood afternoon, everyone. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Mark Patterson, our CFO. Cisco's earnings press release and supplemental information, including GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our Investor Relations website. Following this call, we will also make the recorded webcast and slides available on the website.\r\nThroughout today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons will be made on a year-over-year basis. Please note that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including our guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year 2026.\r\nThese statements are subject to risks and uncertainties detailed in our SEC filings, particularly our most recent 10-K and 10-Q reports, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements.\r\nWith respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.  \r\nNow I'll turn it over to Chuck.\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nThanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We had a strong close to fiscal '25, delivering revenue and gross margin at the high end of our guidance ranges for the fourth quarter. Continued operating leverage across our business produced strong profitability with earnings per share above the high end of our guidance. In addition, we generated solid growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations and subscription revenue, which provides a strong foundation for our future performance.\r\nThe profitable growth of our business continues to produce strong cash flows, supporting our commitment to deliver consistent capital returns. In Q4, we returned $2.9 billion in capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends bringing the total return in fiscal '25 to $12.4 billion in value or 94% of free cash flow, surpassing the $12.1 billion Cisco returned to shareholders in fiscal '24. Overall, our FY '25 performance has established a solid foundation as we turn our focus to delivering Cisco's strongest year yet in fiscal year '26 as indicated in our guidance.\r\nAs we move into the next phase of AI with agents autonomously conducting tasks alongside humans, the capacity requirements of the network will be compounded to accommodate both unprecedented levels of network traffic and an increasing threat landscape. According to our survey of IT networking leaders, 97% of businesses believe they need to upgrade their networks to successfully deploy AI.\r\nHaving refreshed almost our entire product portfolio with industry-leading networking systems powered by Silicon One, AI native security solutions and software operating systems, Cisco is well positioned to provide the critical infrastructure needed for the AI era.\r\nNow let me comment on the demand we saw in Q4, starting with record AI infrastructure orders received from webscale customers. These orders exceeded $800 million in the quarter, bringing the total for fiscal year '25 to over $2 billion, more than double our original $1 billion target stated in Q4 of fiscal year '24. This demonstrates the undeniable capability and relevance of our technology for multiple back-end use cases with some of the most technologically advanced customers.\r\nOverall, total product orders in Q4 grew 7% year-over-year with solid growth across all geographies despite a complex environment, demonstrating the valuable outcomes we continue to deliver for customers worldwide. Enterprise product orders were up 5% year-over-year in Q4. As typical for the fourth quarter, we closed several very large deals with major enterprises across different industries who are compounding the value of their investments by leveraging the full breadth of our technology platforms.\r\nWe have a slide in our earnings presentation that highlights both the breadth of Cisco's reach through 8-figure or larger deals and the versatility of solutions tailored to our customers' needs. Public sector orders were down 6% year-over-year in Q4 compared with a very strong fourth quarter in FY '24 when orders grew double digits year-over-year. That said, overall public sector demand grew sequentially in line with normal seasonality. Product orders from service provider and cloud customers continue to be very strong, up 49% year-over-year, driven by triple-digit order growth in webscale for the fourth consecutive quarter, with 4 out of the top 6 webscale customers each growing orders in the triple digits.\r\nIn fact, two webscale customers each placed total orders of over $1 billion for networking, security, collaboration and observability in FY '25. Demand from telco and cable customers was also strong in Q4 with orders growing more than 20% year-over-year. Now some color on demand for our core networking and security solutions. Networking product orders grew double digits in Q4, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, driven by webscale infrastructure, switching, enterprise routing, industrial IoT and servers.\r\nThere is strong interest from customers in the new family of Cisco Cat9k smart switches along with a completely refreshed lineup of highly secure routers, wireless access points and industrial IoT devices, which are purpose-built for the AI-ready campus and branch. Our new smart switches are powered by Silicon One and deliver enhanced performance, quantum secure networking and radically simplified cloud-native and AI-driven operations, all supporting the new realities as AI changes how we work and collaborate.\r\nThe introduction of our new switches marks the beginning of a major multiyear refresh cycle opportunity for Cisco's large installed campus switching base. Orders for our industrial IoT portfolio comprised of ruggedized catalyst products grew double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter, and we see solid demand signals continuing into FY '26, as countries around the world are committing to U.S. domestic investments as part of their trade agreements.\r\nAs more strategic infrastructure and manufacturing is brought onshore to the United States, Cisco is well positioned to help connect and protect these capital-intensive investments at scale. As I mentioned earlier, the AI infrastructure orders we received from webscale customers were once again exceptionally strong, exceeding $800 million in the quarter. As expected, the product mix of these orders was more than 2/3 in Systems with the remainder in Optics.\r\nIn the enterprise specifically, while still early, AI orders are ramping and we have a growing pipeline in the hundreds of millions as these customers look to Cisco to provide simple, scalable and secure solutions for the AI era. Our expanding partnership with NVIDIA also positions us to deliver on these new demands with completed integrations of Cisco Nexus switches with NVIDIA's Spectrum-X architecture, offering low latency, high-speed networking for AI clusters.\r\nAdditionally, the Cisco Secure AI factory with NVIDIA provides a trusted blueprint for building secure AI-ready data centers for enterprises, sovereign cloud providers and newly emerging Neocloud providers. \r\nWe also see the opportunity with Neocloud providers ramping with several large deals in Q4, not included in the previously mentioned AI infrastructure orders. Our newly forged Middle East strategic partnerships, including HUMAIN, G42 and Stargate UAE, are all progressing as planned, and we expect the sovereign AI opportunity to build momentum in the second half of fiscal year '26. We believe Cisco will be a core system provider for these significant AI training and inference cluster build-outs and integral to their development and eventual hyperscaling. \r\nAs we look holistically at the AI opportunity for Cisco, we frame it into three distinct but connected pillars. First, AI training infrastructure for webscale customers. Combinations of our Cisco 8K, Silicon One, optics and optical systems are being deployed by the largest web scalers, and we expect demand for these technologies from Neocloud providers and sovereign customers to increase in fiscal year '26. \r\nSecond, AI inference and enterprise clouds. Our accelerated innovation in hardware and software, coupled with our NVIDIA partnership, is designed to simplify, accelerate and derisk AI infrastructure deployments for the enterprise. \r\nAnd third, AI network connectivity. Customers are leveraging Cisco platforms to help modernize, secure and automate their network operations to prepare for pervasive deployment of AI agents and applications. As we move towards Agentic AI and the demand for inferencing expands to the enterprise and end-user networking environments, traffic on the network will reach unprecedented levels.  \r\nNetwork traffic will not only increase beyond the peaks of current chatbot interaction, but will remain consistently high with agents in constant interaction. We have a slide illustrating this new traffic model in our earnings presentation available on our website.\r\nAs agents gain autonomous decision-making and action capabilities, security will be even more critical to ensure they operate reliably and safely. As a trusted partner for enterprises, hyperscalers, Neocloud and sovereign cloud providers alike, Cisco has the opportunity to lead this generational transition in networking and security and provide the critical infrastructure needed for the AI era.  \r\nNow shifting to security. We recorded mid-single-digit growth in orders in Q4. Splunk and Cisco synergies delivered a 14% year-over-year increase in new logos for Splunk in Q4, demonstrating the benefit of our cross-selling motions and joint innovation. Our new and refreshed products, including Secure Access, XDR, Hypershield and AI Defense, also continue to ramp and added 750 new customers collectively in the quarter. The vast majority of our new Hypershield enterprise customers are bundling with our N9300 smart switch which enables them to embed security directly into the fabric of the network.\r\nWe believe that Agentic AI can only be secured by fusing security deep into the network and that only Cisco can deliver this capability. Now I'd like to comment on our accelerating innovation pipeline. At Cisco Live U.S. in June, we delivered our largest innovation payload to date, announcing over 20 new customer-centric offerings across our portfolio to help our customers build AI-ready data centers and future-proof their workplaces with a foundational layer of digital resilience.\r\nYou can see the full list of product launches in our slide deck, but I'd like to highlight our AgenticOps, which are already resonating with customers. Cisco AI Canvas is a revolutionary generative user interface for real-time collaboration between network and security teams, optimized for both human and agent interaction. Powered by Cisco's advanced deep network model LLM, AI Canvas unifies real-time telemetry across various platforms to radically simplify IT operations and accelerate troubleshooting.\r\nAll of our new innovations introduced in FY '25, spanning core networking products based on Cisco Silicon One, advanced security technologies and unified management tools are designed on the foundation of AI further enhancing Cisco's platform advantage, where every technology doesn't just add value by itself, but compounds the value of our customers' existing investments.\r\nWe continue to use GenAI and Agentic systems across our customer experience organization with things like services as code and AI agents for in-product support, renewals and adoption. Today, over 2/3 of support cases are touched by AI and automation, which increases the proportion of complex cases we can solve within one day. We're also seeing increased usage of Cisco's own proprietary AI application internally with more advanced use cases emerging across engineering, sales, operations and our people policy and purpose organization, resulting in meaningful productivity gains for our teams.\r\nTo summarize, we are seeing clear demand for our technology across customer markets in addition to expanded opportunities as we move towards Agentic AI. We are innovating faster than ever before, making AI foundational in our designs, fusing security deep into our networking products and providing operational simplicity for our customers. And our strong performance is fueling our capital allocation model, returning significant value to our shareholders, while positioning our business for success in fiscal '26.\r\nBefore I close, I'd like to once again thank Scott Herren for his leadership and partnership over the last 5 years. Scott has been instrumental in driving our transition to more software and recurring revenue, which has driven greater predictability for our business and increased shareholder value. We wish you all the best in your retirement. I'd also like to take a moment to thank our teams for their hard work to close out the year for executing with urgency as One Cisco and most importantly, for their unfailing focus on delivering valuable outcomes for our customers.\r\nNow I'll turn it over to Mark for more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\n\n## Mark Patterson (Executives)\nThanks, Chuck. We delivered a strong quarter with revenue and non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin at the high end of our guidance range and earnings per share above the high end of our guidance, coupled with solid operating cash flow. For the quarter, total revenue was $14.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $4 billion, up 12% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.99, up 14%, demonstrating good operating leverage with EPS growth outpacing revenue growth.\r\nBefore we dive into the details, it's worth reiterating as a reminder that we had a full 13-week contribution from Splunk in Q4 FY '24 last year. So our reported year-over-year growth rates are fully comparable this quarter. Looking at our Q4 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $10.9 billion, up 10%. Services revenue was $3.8 billion, flat year-over-year. Networking was up 12%, with growth across most of the portfolio, led by double-digit growth in Internet infrastructure and enterprise routing as well as solid growth in switching, partially offset by a decline in servers.\r\nSecurity was up 9%, primarily driven by growth in our offerings from Splunk and SASE. Collaboration was up 2%, driven by solid growth in devices. Observability was up 4%, led by strong growth in Splunk and ThousandEyes. Looking at our recurring metrics. Total RPO was $43.5 billion, up 6%, Product RPO grew 8%, and total short-term RPO was $21.7 billion, up 4%.\r\nTotal ARR ended the quarter at $31.1 billion, an increase of 5% with product ARR growth of 8%. Total subscription revenue increased 3% to $7.9 billion and represents 54% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 5% at $5.6 billion, with software subscription revenue also up 5%. Q4 product orders were up 7% year-over-year. Looking at our product orders across geographic segments. The Americas was up 5%. EMEA was up 10%, and APJC was up 7%. In our customer markets, service provider and cloud was up 49%. Enterprise was up 5% and public sector was down 6%.\r\nTotal non-GAAP gross margin came in at 68.4%, up 50 basis points year-over-year, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 67.5%, up 50 basis points, driven by productivity improvements. Non-GAAP services gross margin was 70.8%, also up 50 basis points.\r\nOur total gross margin included a small impact from tariffs, which was slightly favorable compared to our estimate that was included in our guidance. We continue our focus on profitability and financial discipline with non-GAAP operating margin of 34.3% at the high end of our guidance range.\r\nOur non-GAAP tax rate was 18.1% for the quarter. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $16.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $4.2 billion, up 14%, primarily driven by our revenue and earnings growth. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders during the quarter comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of our share repurchases with $14.2 billion now remaining under our share repurchase program.\r\nTurning to the full fiscal year. Revenue was $56.7 billion, up 5%. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 68.7%, up 120 basis points. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $15.2 billion, flat year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.81, which was up 2%. Operating cash flow was $14.2 billion, up 30% compared to FY '24.\r\nCash flow growth from the full year was positively impacted by some large tax payments in early FY '24 that did not repeat in FY '25. We returned $12.4 billion in value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. This was comprised of $6.4 billion in quarterly cash dividends and $6 billion of share repurchases. We increased our dividend for the 14th consecutive year in FY '25, reinforcing our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows.\r\nTo summarize, we had a solid fiscal quarter and year with top and bottom line performance, meeting and exceeding our expectations, driven by strong order growth and margins. For the full fiscal 2025, we delivered record non-GAAP operating income and margin, demonstrating our ability to provide operating leverage, while driving strong top line growth. We remain focused on making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities we see ahead. This will continue to be underpinned by disciplined spend management. And it's this powerful combination that continues to fuel strong cash flow and our ability to return significant value to our shareholders.\r\nTurning to guidance. While we have some clarity on tariffs, we are still operating in a complex environment. Our Q1 and fiscal year 2026 guide assumes current tariffs and exemptions remain in place through the end of fiscal 2026. These include the following: China at 30%, partially offset by an exemption for semiconductors and certain electronic components; Mexico at 25% and; Canada at 35% for the components and products that are not eligible for the current USMCA exemptions. \r\nOther countries reverted to country-specific reciprocal rates, but largely offset by an exemption for semiconductors and certain electronic components.  \r\nAnd finally, a small impact from tariffs on copper, steel and aluminum and retaliatory tariffs. We will continue to leverage our world-class supply chain team to help mitigate the impact of tariffs where appropriate. Through the flexibility and agility we have built into our operations over the last few years, the size and scale of our supply chain provides us with some unique advantages as we support our customers globally. \r\nLooking ahead, you can expect us to continue our focus on durable growth with financial discipline in driving operating leverage and continued capital returns. Our fiscal Q1 guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $14.65 billion to $14.85 billion; we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 67.5% to 68.5%; non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34%; non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.97 to $0.99. We are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%.\r\nFor fiscal year '26, our guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $59 billion to $60 billion; non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range from $4 to $4.06. \r\nSami, let's now move into the Q&A.\n\n## Ahmed Sami Badri (Executives)\nThank you, Mark. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I would like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Michelle, can we move to the first analyst in the queue?\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\n\n## Aaron Rakers (Analysts)\nI guess my first question is, looking at your guidance and given the commentary around the AI opportunity and reflective of sovereign starting to kick in into the second half of the fiscal year, just kind of taking the midpoint, it would seem to assume you've got some deceleration of growth from, call it, 6.5%, 7%.\r\nWe guided for fiscal first quarter to about 4.5% going into the remaining 3 quarters. I'm curious, does that reflect conservatism? Is there any change in the demand environment that you're factoring in? I'm just -- I'm kind of curious how we bridge maybe that deceleration through the remaining quarters of the fiscal year.\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nAaron, thanks. So let me just say that the AI opportunity is clearly one that we have been pleased with our execution on -- and as we look out -- I think the dynamic that you're talking about is strictly connected to just year-over-year comps later in the year. I don't think it's got -- it hasn't -- it's not meant to signal any change in demand or anything that we think.\r\nI think one of the questions that I expect is does the campus refresh begin to kick in? And should that be a big revenue driver next fiscal year? And if you think about the campus the Cat9k is in year 8 of this transition. So it's -- and lots of customers will take a lot of time to evaluate that and look at those products before they begin to deploy them. So we think that's going to kick in next year as well. And we're pleased with the progress we made on AI. But I think the annual progression is really related to comps. Mark, do you have anything to add?\n\n## Mark Patterson (Executives)\nNo, I think that's right, Chuck. You have to think back as well in prior year, other than Q4, that's the first quarter that really was apples-to-apples in terms of having Splunk in the prior year. So some of the growth rates before Q4 were obviously higher than they would be otherwise.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nMeta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\n\n## Meta Marshall (Analysts)\nGreat. Maybe a couple for me. Just one, how are you looking at security and business maybe in particular, you've now anniversaried at Splunk as you guys just mentioned, but just kind of how are you looking at the growth outlook there as you have some kind of new products and old products cascading in? And then maybe second, just new CFO priorities would be great to kind of level set.\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nAll right. Why don't I cover security and Mark, you can obviously cover CFO priorities. Meta, thanks for the questions. I would say that I am more optimistic about security coming out of the last quarter, and I'll tell you why. Last quarter, I explained to all of you that we really have two sets of products. We have the set that is new and refreshed and that's the SASE, XDR, Hypershield, AI Defense as well as our refreshed firewall portfolio. And then we have the area of older products that are not huge investment areas for us, right now are kind of the long tail of the life cycle.\r\nIf you look at those new products and new and refreshed, again, including our refreshed firewalls, we saw order growth during the quarter in excess of 20%. So they continue to have widespread adoption. But perhaps the metric that I think will give you more confidence here is, if you take out U.S. Federal, which had a tough year as we all know, rest of world security order growth in Q4 was up double digits.\r\nSo we're really -- we're seeing this ramp, and I told -- I think I said on the last call, it's happening slower than I had anticipated. A lot of it is because the stuff is ratable. But I feel good about where we are. We have 80 new Hypershield customers largely connected to this new smart switch, so that strategy is working. And I would say that we had 480-plus new SSE customers during the quarter. So that's -- our Secure Services Edge is really getting good traction. \r\nAnd what I would say is based on how we see this stuff evolving, I would see the growth rate continuing to improve as we get through the fiscal year this year. So that's the story on security. Mark, do you want to take the second question?\n\n## Mark Patterson (Executives)\nSure. Thanks, Meta, for your question. First off, I just want to thank Scott, been certainly a good partner for many years and for the work that he's done with Cisco in particular, I think, helping us make that transition to software and subscription. I've been with the company now 25 years in a variety of roles and responsibilities. And I think as I look ahead, we have significant opportunity, whether it's in AI infrastructure, in the webscale space, now in the nascent, but growing enterprise AI opportunity. Obviously, Neoclouds and the sovereign AI build-out happening.\r\nAlso, you look to cybersecurity and how we've improved our hand there with Splunk and then the campus refresh that we've got ahead of us, which will be multiyear. I think we've got great opportunity. And what I really want to do is make sure that we're funded for success. And we're looking at those opportunities for what do we need to do to be successful. I also think in terms of expectations of me, you can expect that I will be focused on durable, profitable growth, obviously, financial discipline and transparency and really just returning value to the shareholders.\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nI want to add one more thing, Meta, on the security front that I failed to mention. Another positive thing that happened during the quarter, we've had 2 consecutive quarters now relative to Splunk. If you recall, one of the big things we thought we could do is bring them new customers by cross-selling Splunk into customers they had not been in. And in Q3 and Q4, we had over 300 new logos for Splunk new customers that bought Splunk for the first time. So that strategy seems to be working. The teams are doing really good job there, which is another reason I have confidence in the security strategy this year.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nSimon Leopold with Raymond James.\n\n## Simon Leopold (Analysts)\nFirst one, I wanted to ask about this idea of pull forward. I appreciate customers may not communicate their rationale, reasons for placing particular orders. But I'm concerned that particularly in the federal vertical with potential budget cuts and enterprises worried about the implications from tariffs may have accelerated some of the orders, therefore, pulling them from the later quarters.\r\nAnd then as my follow-up, I'm wondering if you could talk about your expectations over the longer term for the composition of the AI business. We've got the 2/3, 1/3 split between systems and optics and I'm wondering how you expect that to trend? Or is this an expected steady state?\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nThanks, Simon. I'll make a couple of comments on the pull forward, then Mark, you can give some data points on why we're pretty confident that hasn't happened at scale. We've looked at -- there's lots of metrics that we look at here. And I talk to customers constantly. We talk to our field teams constantly. And I haven't heard one instance in the last 6 months of a single customer who said, \"I'm going to order this now before price increases occur.\" Not that we're increasing prices, we haven't announced anything like that. But I'm just saying that's the theory that you're putting forward. So I'm not suggesting that it hasn't happened somewhere, but I think I would have heard it if it was pervasive. Mark?\n\n## Mark Patterson (Executives)\nYes. Just to add maybe a few data points. Certainly, we talked to many channel partners. Also look at our typical linearity from month 1, 2, 3, et cetera, that all look good. We have -- on many of our products, we actually have software that gets activated once it's shipped. So one of the things we look at is really that time from shipment to activation and to see if that is stretched out at all. It did not as well. We also look at ship dates requested from customers.\r\nAnd if those are sliding, then that might be an indication that they don't really want the gear yet, but they wanted to get an order in early, didn't see any issue there either. And then really just, of course, we looked at pipeline pull forwards and nothing unusual there either. So we're pretty confident that we haven't seen any indication of any pull forwards.\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nAnd Simon, on your second question, the AI business composition, specifically in the back-end networks today of the cloud providers, I don't see anything that would indicate a massive shift there based on the conversations we're having with them. I don't -- I haven't heard anything that would lead me to believe that, that shift changes meaningfully.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nSamik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\n\n## Samik Chatterjee (Analysts)\nYes, great. Maybe, Chuck, if I can sort of ask you more on the networking cycle here, particularly that there was a period of time that you went through a digestion with customers and then you started to see the recovery in the networking cycle.\r\nThere's been 2 quarters of solid growth on that front. As you think about next year or fiscal '26, how do you sort of see that growth sustaining, particularly if we sort of put aside the new upgrades in relation to Cat9k upgrades that you're looking at like where are customers in terms of their intent to upgrade legacy infrastructure? And basically, what I'm trying to get to is at the Investor Day, you had talked about 2% to 5% being the range of networking through the medium term. And where do you think you land on that front in fiscal '26.\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nThanks, Samik. I think that if you step back, there's two things going on. There's this AI -- there's AI revolution that we can talk about, and then there's the refresh opportunity. And if you think about the AI revolution, what we are seeing, and we've seen this with transitions over the last decade or so that we tend to see these things begin first in the cloud providers, which we're clearly seeing the AI play in the cloud providers, then we see it shift into the enterprise. Well, we see it shift in the back -- end in this case, from the back end to the front end, we believe that will occur as enterprises start using more of these services.\r\nAnd then enterprises will also build out inferencing as we know, on-prem in addition to that. And we're even seeing the telco business actually pick up as they're actually telling us they're increasing their network capacity and they're modernizing their infrastructure in preparation for AI. So we think that AI is going to drive network modernization across all of these segments. And then you have the campus upgrade, which we really haven't started yet. And if you think about what the comment I made earlier, we've got routing refresh. We've got a lot of new technology in our data center networking business, which, by the way, grew mid-teens orders last fiscal year in the enterprise.\r\nWe have WiFi 7, which grew triple digits year-over-year. So we're seeing good uptake there and we got the new campus products. But the new campus switching, again, we're in year 8 of the Cat9k. And honestly, if you look at products that were pre Cat9k that are still installed in our customer base, there's tens of billions of dollars of installed base that's there that we can go after. So we think that all of that leads us to feel very confident about maintaining the range that we provided at Analyst Day on core networking.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nMichael Ng with Goldman Sachs.\n\n## Michael Ng (Analysts)\nI just have two as well. First on AI, I was wondering if you could talk about the greater than $2 billion AI orders this year. Did that translate into revenue in the year? And how should we think about that translating into revenue for next. And then second, just on networking. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the orders in the quarter by subsegment, campus and data center switching, wireless, routing, and any kind of notable inflections that you would call out in any of those product categories?\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nSure, Michael. Let me take some comments first on the -- I want to just give a clarity on the webscale business and what it looked like, and then Mark can talk about the revenue in FY '25 related to their AI infrastructure orders. So I just want to make sure everybody understands our webscale business. First of all, we sell technology into the back end. We sell technology into the front end or the traditional cloud networks, and we sell our enterprise portfolio to these customers as well. And if you look at our entire portfolio, these customers in aggregate grew triple digits 4 quarters in a row from an orders perspective.\r\nWe had four of them that grew triple digit in Q4 by themselves. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we had two of these customers across the portfolio that placed orders in excess of $1 billion each in fiscal year '25. So if you think back 5 years ago, we were talking about our strategy in this space, this was definitely not the case. So we feel good about the progress we made. And then I think you understood on the AI infrastructure, we had greater than $800 million in orders during the quarter and we have greater than $2 billion on the year, more than double our original target. Mark, do you want to talk a little bit about the revenue?\n\n## Mark Patterson (Executives)\nSure. Yes. In terms of revenue and shipments related to those AI orders, those really just progressed and ramped like we expected during FY '25. So for the full year, we recognized right about $1 billion in revenue related to those.\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nSo we recognized roughly $1 billion of revenue on the AI back-end orders that we've taken from the webscale customers during fiscal year '25.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAmit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\n\n## Amit Daryanani (Analysts)\nI have two as well. Chuck, maybe just on the AI side, as you were talking about that a little bit here. Can you just touch on AI adoption by enterprises and how do you really think that opportunity on the enterprise side shape up given I think Silicon One is the only partner Silicon that NVIDIA is supporting right now. So can you talk about how big do you think this enterprise opportunity is?\r\nAnd when do you start to see revenues or orders flow into that? And then my follow-up, maybe just continuing on to the prior answer for Chuck, how much revenue contribution are you embedding in fiscal '26 from AI given the $2 billion order that you had this year?\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nYes, Amit, good question. So on the enterprise side, we saw orders and these are orders that are really sort of networking and AI GPU related. I think in our remarks we talked about earlier, they're about half and half. And we saw a few hundred million dollars that move through, and we have hundreds of millions in the pipeline right now for enterprise.\r\nI'd say that there's a lot of pilots going. There's a lot of work going on with customers who are piloting different applications in retail environments, et cetera. So we think it will start to ramp. And then we think that you'll see AI applications ramp. And in the second half of the year, we think you're going to see Agentic proof-of-concepts become more, I'd say, pervasive and that's going to require, obviously, network connectivity, network capacity, low latency and candidly, you're going to -- we're going to have to put security into the fabric of the network because, as we talked about earlier, these Agentic workflows, they're going to be in constant communication, whether you think about general agents or you think about robotics, you're going to -- the importance of the low latency connectivity is going to be huge and the security is going to be huge.\r\nAnd the only way to do both of those is defuse security into the core of the network. So that's our plan. That's why we're working so hard on what we're working on. In the NVIDIA space, I'd say a lot of the development is going on. I would just say we -- I don't believe we've seen the meaningful benefit of that partnership yet, and we've got some good development that's been completed. We got a lot of milestones that are going to be done in the next few months. And we think that as the enterprise really begins to ramp up that partnership and our portfolio, we think we'll be in good shape to help them out.\r\nOn the revenue contribution from fiscal year '26 relative to AI, I would just say that we don't really guide by specific parts of the technology. But given that we had $1 billion in FY '25, you can probably extrapolate out what you think we'll do in '26 because we got the backlog, and we have the new orders that we take down during the year.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nTal Liani with Bank of America.\n\n## Tal Liani (Analysts)\nTwo questions, I will ask them both together. Service revenues, kind of 25% of revenues, flat this quarter. And if you look at the trend line over the last 5 quarters, the growth decelerated from 6.5% to 5.5% to 2.5%, now 0%.  What are the trends in service revenues? And what should we expect going forward? That's question number one. \r\nAnd question number two is the networking growth, it's driven by spending of -- spending in investments by cloud. How much risk is there that this year is a phenomenal year for spending and trends would slow down next year just because Oracle is not going to grow again another 150% and Meta is not going to grow again another 70%, 80%, et cetera. So what's the sustainability of these growth rates in your view?\n\n## Mark Patterson (Executives)\nTal, it's Mark. So thanks for the question. I think I'll take the service one and then I'll let Chuck answer your second question. So on the services, if you go back a year ago and even a little bit longer ago, you saw a lot of professional services that we did, really helping our customers and our partners, frankly, working hand-in-hand to implement a lot of that gear that we had shipped.\r\nIf you remember, all that excess backlog that we sort of unloaded on our customers, if you will, we were helping do that. So that drove nice growth in our services business for a while. What we usually do see, as you know, as services usually trails or sort of follows on to what's happening in product, for instance. So as we saw networking growth of 12% this quarter, I would expect that you'll start to see services pick up as revenue on services is ratable. So we do expect that, that will improve as we go into FY '26.\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nAnd then on the risk issue, all I could say, Tal, is that we see the same CapEx year-over-year growth numbers that you see. And I think the aggregate number is like 50% up. So I don't feel like AI is a fleeting trend. I do understand your question, but I think we're operating off the demand signals we're getting from those customers and what they're signaling relative to how they're spending CapEx.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nBen Reitzes with Melius Research.\n\n## Benjamin Reitzes (Analysts)\nChuck, I mean, I think some folks were trying to get at this in an earlier question. But security, I mean your execution in switching and the AI stuff is obviously better than expected, but the security was pretty well below the street and it has to accelerate pretty significantly to get to your 15% to 17% growth for security plus observability long-term target. I mean is that still the right way to think of that business, Chuck? Is that where you think you can at least end the year? And if not, is it worth rethinking that it's a high single-digit grower? Just wondering on that. And then I have a quick follow-up.\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nDo you want to ask it now? Ben, we're writing them down, so.\n\n## Benjamin Reitzes (Analysts)\nOkay. Well, I was just -- on the -- I was wondering on the HUMAIN and some of these sovereigns, you mentioned the NVIDIA deal so much. But on one of them, you're working with AMD. I'm just wondering with regard to your partnering outside of NVIDIA in the AI land, how much is that a focus? And is that something that you're able to do as well?\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nYes. So first of all, I gave you the data earlier when I was talking about security. And I talked about the fact that  ex-Fed we saw security orders grow in double digits, which is pretty positive compared to where we've been and these new and refreshed products that I talked about that included Secure Access, XDR, Hypershield, AI Defense, new firewalls and identity, which is super important these days. And Agentic, the refreshed identity portfolio. We saw that growing in excess of 20%. And that's currently about 2/3 of the organic security portfolio.\r\nSo through the year, what you're going to see is that just continue to become a bigger and bigger part so that the third that's sort of the legacy stuff will have a lower impact -- we'll continue to have a lower and lower negative impact on that as we get through the year. So to answer your question directly, number one, I don't think we should change those ranges. Number two, do I believe we'll exit the year at it? I think we're going to exit the year either near it or on a path to get there pretty soon after that. That's first. \r\nOn the HUMAIN and on the sovereign side, we are working very closely with AMD on a couple of those, and you should assume that we will have a very, very tight partnership with them as well so that we're -- primarily so that we can deliver highly integrated solutions to these customers as we work with them going forward. So Lisa and I talk fairly regularly. As you all know, she used to be on our Board. So we have a great relationship, and you should assume that we'll have a tight partnership where we need to deliver outcomes for these customers.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nJames Fish with Piper Sandler.\n\n## James Fish (Analysts)\nI know, Chuck, Meta asked about this a little bit earlier. Is there a way to think about for every dollar of Cat9k refresh, how many dollars are kind of coming off of the other solutions, be it wireless LAN, firewall, other security products and just to follow-up on the last question here, anniversary-ing Splunk. How are you guys thinking about your own use of capital given big M&A and security, once again, I'm surprised I'm the first one to ask about this given the CyberArk deal. And how are you thinking about that identity and privileged access space, given you're going to have more AI to AI or machine to machine interactions occurring in the future?\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nYes. So Mark, feel free to comment. But I don't think there's a way to really correlate. I didn't completely understand that first question about the correlation.\n\n## Mark Patterson (Executives)\nYes. I think he's asking, can you correlate the Cat9k to sort of other campus devices around it, if you will, it actually sounds like a great idea. I'd love for that model. But there are so many other new devices that we launched as well, if you will. I mean the smart routers, the smart switches, but also new WiFi access points, et cetera. So it's definitely something that we'll take a look at, but I don't think it's that easy, if you will.\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nSo on the second one, Mark, let's talk about capital and how you -- how we plan to use it or nothing's really changed, and I'll talk about identity.\n\n## Mark Patterson (Executives)\nYes. So if you look at FY '25, first off, we returned $12.4 billion to the shareholders. So 94% of our free cash flow. As you look at it going forward and probably important for you to hear this from me too. Number one, the first priority is just to support the growth of the business. Secondly is to support the dividend, obviously, which we have been increasing each year for some time. Another is just to really offset dilution would be the third priority. And then fourth, I'd just say being opportunistic on how we can additionally bring value to our shareholders.\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nAnd then specifically on identity in relation to the announced acquisition, I think it's -- that actually underscores what we've known for 10-plus years, which is the importance of identity and Zero Trust architectures. It's a core pillar of our platform strategy. It's not an add-on. We have great leadership in this space, a lot of deep knowledge and innovation with Duo and ICE, strategic acquisitions like Duo and Oort that we already have on board. Q4 Duo growth was off the charts with a lot of the new capabilities that the teams have built in for the customers as customers just today look at Zero Trust architectures relative to their employees. But we're already working on Agentic identity, which is something that's really important.\r\nAnd I think that the good news for us is we don't have to wait for an acquisition to close. We have a lot of great talent that's already working on this. And again, I think the advantage that we're going to have here with identity and Agentic security is that you're going to have to do it real time. And we are the only company that has networking and security and identity, specifically within security, so we think that gives us an advantage.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nDavid Vogt with UBS.\n\n## David Vogt (Analysts)\nI have two as well. So Chuck, I recognize you don't guide to specific product growth. But if I think about your order intake has been averaging at least kind of roughly 50% on average for SP. And if I use that as a proxy in fiscal '26, it looks like AI could add about 2 points of revenue growth to sort of the networking business in '26. And is that kind of the right way to frame it? And the rest is really the recovery or maybe the refresh cycle in campus and strength in enterprise?\r\nAnd then, Mark, my second question for you is I appreciate all the detail on the tariff impact, I appreciate that in the slide, but can you help us frame from a gross margin impact, is it a 50 basis point headwind in your guide for fiscal '26 based on where current tariff rates are and how you're thinking about it for the full year?\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nYes. Let me answer the first one, and then Mark can talk about tariffs. On the -- I think you're generally in the ballpark, I think I don't know specifically how many points, but we do expect both sides to be contributing pretty meaningfully. I think we did an analysis of our overarching growth in Q4. And I think that even if you normalize out web, it made a 1 point differential, I think. So I think you're close.\n\n## Mark Patterson (Executives)\nYes. As far as tariffs, they were really a small impact in Q4 as well as for FY '25. And rather than sizing the dollar amount, what I really wanted to do is give you the assumptions that underpin the guide and really reinforce that the components that are part of that certainly, China at 30% with the continuing offset by the exemption for the semiconductors and certain electronic components. Mexico at 25%, Canada 35%, and those are only for the components that do not qualify under USMCA.\r\nAnd then other countries going back to the reciprocal rates that are largely offset by those exemptions for semiconductors and electronic components plus some small tariffs related to steel, aluminum and copper. So really just wanted to make sure you knew the exact assumptions that are into the guide.\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nYes, it's very difficult to include anything that hasn't been announced yet because it's such a dynamic environment.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nKarl Ackerman with BNP Paribas.\n\n## Karl Ackerman (Analysts)\nTwo for me as well, and I'll ask them at the same time. Within your fiscal '26 outlook, I was hoping you could rank order of the segments that give you the most conviction in hitting the target that you laid out. Second, Chuck, you indicated that Silicon One should grow as a portion of your Nexus smart switches over time. And I was hoping you could discuss whether Silicon One can represent half of your switch ASICs in the next 3 years.\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nThat's a great question. So if I rank order the segments, I'd say I still remain very optimistic on SP. Probably secondly, enterprise and probably third public sector. But I would like to comment on public sector and give you another -- give you all another data point. Our overall order growth or bookings growth of 7%. If you know -- if you take out federal, the rest of the world grew at 10%. So we saw good performance outside of federal.\r\nWhen we think about federal in fiscal year '26, just to put it in perspective, our teams are forecasting a return to growth for federal during this fiscal year. Now it's not going to be the same -- it's not going to be as high of growth as we saw a decline. So we'll still be below FY '25 levels. But the good news is they're forecasting growth. So that's better. But I still think I would stack rank them, service provider, enterprise and service provider, including cloud, obviously, and then enterprise and public sector.\r\nOn the Nexus portfolio, so you've got -- I think we've got the 800-gig Nexus product that is Silicon One based. We've got the smart switches that will be Silicon One based. So it's our intent to actually drive this as fast as we possibly can. And so I think your assumption is not too far off.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAtif Malik with Citi.\n\n## Adrienne Colby (Analysts)\nIt's Adrienne Colby for Atif. The EMEA orders accelerated in the quarter, and I was hoping you could provide some color there. And I also wanted to just circle back on the sovereign AI opportunities about your expectations in terms of order flow and revenue recognition there.\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nOkay. Great. So if you look at EMEA, we saw 10% overall orders. Enterprise was up in the mid-teens. Public sector, roughly flat, SP in the mid-teens. We saw strength in the U.K., Germany, Saudi. SP was strong, security was strong, a little -- obviously flat in public sector. We'd like to see it a little better. And I think there in Europe, I think we see opportunities. \r\nThere's a couple of things going on. Number one, there's a lot of focus on sovereignty and a lot of focus on building out their own tech stack and tech solutions. In many cases, they are very keen on having on-prem solutions like think on-prem Splunk or on-prem WebEx from a sovereignty and geopolitical perspective, that's just where they're going. \r\nSo we think the opportunity there and the defense spending and everything else, we think that will continue to be a good opportunity for us in Europe. In that space, obviously, in Europe, Middle East, Africa, we've got a couple of sovereigns that we've announced. And we have not taken any orders from them yet. We've been in the planning phases with them. They're obviously working through getting the licenses for the GPUs. And we sort of expect that's going to -- I would lean towards looking for that even the order flow to be sort of middle year into the second half, and then revenue would follow.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nSebastien Naji with William Blair.\n\n## Sebastien Cyrus Naji (Analysts)\nMy first question is on the back-end AI network opportunity, but maybe a little bit more longer term. There's a lot of chatter from your main silicon competitor about new chips that are going to enable Ethernet for scale-up connectivity. So within the racks, I wanted just to ask what your expectations are for Ethernet and scale up going forward and if we should expect new Silicon One announcements tailored to that opportunity?\r\nAnd then my second question is just on the campus network. You announced the integration of Meraki and Catalyst platforms at Cisco Live, and I think the reactions have been generally pretty positive. But I'm wondering if you expect this to shift behavior in hardware purchases at all. So could we see, for example, outside strength in Meraki and slower demand for catalyst or vice versa in the next few years?\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nYes, two great questions. So I think on the back-end side, as I've said before, the two -- in the networking side, the two areas where the value is really derived is either in the silicon or in the software. And so given that many of these folks are using a lot of their own operating systems, you have to have silicon deploy in the first place. So the good news is we do. Then when you look at this scale-up opportunity in the back end and the hyperscalers in many -- in most cases, they're not using the clusters with the scale up inside the cluster.\r\nThey're using native connectivity within the clusters and then between clusters. And we think there that, that probably remains the predominant play. We're seeing the desire for some of these clusters in Neocloud, et cetera, because they're easy, but there's still a connectivity layer, obviously, between the clusters. From a scale-up perspective, we think over time, that opportunity could shift to more of an Ethernet variant, which would give us obviously an easy way to play.\r\nWe've got road maps that we're working on that haven't been announced yet, but I think downstream, if that occurs, we could definitely play in that space. On the Meraki Catalyst question, I actually think the opposite is actually -- what you would see is you'd see more openness to catalysts because of the cloud management, the simple cloud management. I think there's 35 million devices now being managed by the cloud. And so it just gives customers choice. It rationalizes the hardware down to a single platform that you can run in either mode. You can run it on-prem or you can run it cloud managed, and I think that's a big benefit for our customers as we go forward.\n\n## Ahmed Sami Badri (Executives)\nThank you, Sebastien. I will now hand it over to Chuck for some closing remarks.\n\n## Charles Robbins (Executives)\nYes. I want to thank everybody for joining today and again reiterate my thanks to our team for all their great work in Q4 and fiscal '25, which really did set a solid foundation for fiscal year '26. Mark, welcome. We're excited about your first earnings and what's ahead. I'm happy to -- I'm really excited about working with you. Obviously, we see good demand for our technology. We see great things working across a great portion of our portfolio.\r\nAI is clearly a major tailwind. The webscale momentum, the emergence of the enterprise, the sovereign and the Neocloud opportunities. We've got the Agentic phase coming along. I feel good about where we are. I feel good about the performance. We still have to continue to execute. And we feel really good that we've got the business positioned for success in '26.  There are certainly a lot of dynamics in a very complex world that we're all managing on a daily basis. But based on what we can control, we feel really good about it. I want to thank you for being with us once again. And Sami, I'll turn it back over to you.\n\n## Ahmed Sami Badri (Executives)\nThanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will outline our first quarter FY '26 results will be on Wednesday, November 12, 2025 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. This concludes today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations department, and we thank you very much for joining the call today.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nThank you for participating on today's conference call.

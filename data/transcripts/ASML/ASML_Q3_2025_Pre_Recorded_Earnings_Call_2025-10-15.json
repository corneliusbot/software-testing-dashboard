We also had a very big Q4 there. \r\nIncluded in that number would be an installed base revenue of approximately EUR 2.1 billion. The gross margin for the quarter, somewhere between 51% and 53%. If you then take that to the full year, we would be looking at a full year around EUR 32.5 billion in terms of net sales. The gross margin, we say around 52%.

Third, we continue to make very good progress with our litho intensity, especially with EUV that continue to be adopted with DRAM and advanced logic customer. \r\nOn the other hand, when we look at China, we believe that the demand of our Chinese customer is going to be significantly lower in 2026 than it has been in 2024 and '25, where we had very strong business there."

I think they're recognized for their business-to-business approach. They're also recognized for the quality of their large language model, particularly when it comes to software coding and software coding development. So they're recognized for that. \r\nThat's the reason why we entered into the partnership with them because many people look at ASML, look at our products and really looking at hardware. But I think increasingly, I think people appreciate the very significant software content that is within those systems. And I think people really understand that if you get to the level of precision and the level of speed that we have in our scanners, but also, quite frankly, what we need in metrology and inspection, it's pretty clear that the software contingent therein becomes increasingly important. \r\nSo that's the reason why this is very strategic to us, why it's very strategic to improving the performance, improving the precision and the speed of our tools as we bring them to our customers. So therefore, this collaboration is truly a strategic choice for us. \r\nI would also say that on top of the significance that it has for our products, it's also -- AI is also a great way to improve the speed of our product development, to improve the speed of our time to market of any product development to our customers. And that's another big area that we're collaborating with Mistral on. \r\nSo all in all, we believe a very strategic partnership. We also, to underscore that strategic partnership, as you know, we were the lead investor for their series, Series C funding round. And by being the lead investor, we took approximately an 11% share in Mistral. We also have a seat on their strategic committee. We truly believe that by doing this, we also get closer and closer to the AI world, which we believe is so pivotal to what we do at ASML."

And some of our customers also reported the fact that the maturity of High NA today is quite ahead of what the maturity of Low NA was at the same period of time.

When we look at those requirements, we also see that a lot of the technology we have developed for holistic lithography can be transferred to 3D integration. And this is why we are looking at several opportunities. \r\nThe XT:260 is the first product. There will be more.

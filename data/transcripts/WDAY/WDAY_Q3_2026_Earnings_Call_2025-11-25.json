On the call, we have Carl Eschenbach, our CEO; Zane Rowe, our CFO; and Gerrit Kazmaier, our President, Product & Technology. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast.\r\nBefore we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today, and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors in documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2025 annual report on Form 10-K for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\r\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website. The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. \r\nAdditionally, the prepared remarks of this call and our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call.

      "text": "Thank you, Justin, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Workday delivered solid Q3 results, with 15% subscription revenue growth and 28.5% non-GAAP operating margin. Our teams executed well, and our value proposition is clearly resonating with organizations around the world. I've been on the road a lot lately, meeting with our customers and prospects, and they're all saying the same thing. They see the potential of AI, but they're stuck with disconnected systems, bad data and closed platforms. That's where Workday gives them the ultimate advantage by unifying HR and finance on one intelligent platform, we deliver business-ready AI that helps organizations adapt quickly, make better decisions and deliver outcomes that truly matter.\r\nNow let's turn to our customer highlights for the quarter. In Q3, we continued to grow across industries, segments and geographies. In HCM, we added new customers, including Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Fuji Electric and The Magnum Ice Cream Company. Core Financials also performed well, driving strong full suite adoption. In fact, half of all net new global deals in Q3 included both HR and finance, with key wins such as Ardent Health, Kelly Services and Specialized. We also expanded with customers such as CommonSpirit Health, Levi Strauss and Novartis. And consistent with recent quarters, our customers' headcount levels continued to grow modestly. And our momentum isn't just from large enterprises. Workday GO is helping us drive strong new customer growth and continued ACV momentum in the medium enterprise. \r\nJust last week, we announced a major expansion of Workday GO, including Global Payroll, an expanded partner network and a new AI powered deployment agent that can cut implementation time by up to 25%. Customers of all sizes and industries tell us that an investment in Workday is an investment in their AI strategy. More than 75% of our core customers are using Workday Illuminate AI, driving well over 1 billion AI actions on the Workday platform this year alone and adoption keeps growing. More than 3/4 of net new deals and 35% of customer expansions included one or more AI products.\r\nAmong the standouts, Evisort delivered another record quarter, and Extend Pro grew net new ACV by more than 50% year-over-year. Altogether, our AI products added more than 1.5 points of ARR growth this quarter. That doesn't include Paradox, which we closed in Q3 and is already off to a strong start. And with the rollout of Flex Credits early next year, we're making it even easier for our customers to adopt our AI and platform innovation.\r\nOur customer footprint spans every major industry. Tech and media and financial services, 2 of our $1 billion industries were standout performers in the quarter. And in Q3, health care became our sixth industry to exceed $1 billion in ARR, with strategic wins like Ardent Health, Ascendiun and Northeast Georgia Medical Center. One of my favorites this quarter was a major win back at a large U.S. health insurer. They were a long-time Workday customer that moved to a competitor several years ago and quickly regretted it. Now they're back with Workday and choosing our full suite with a 10-year commitment.\r\nOur public sector momentum was also strong in Q3. And despite the weeks-long government shutdown, engagement across federal agencies remained high. The Department of Energy's successful go-live in Q3 is a great example. They're the first cabinet-level agency to bring their core HR systems into our FedRAMP-authorized cloud. We're also nearing completion of the first phase of our work with the DIA. This opens up an important long-term opportunity, both with the agency and across the intelligence community and Department of War.\r\nIn SLED, we welcomed new customers including the County of San Luis Obispo, the City of Concord and Cleveland State University, and we expanded with Cornell University, which added both core financials and student. While we had a number of successes across our Fed, SLED and health care teams, we also saw some isolated impacts within institutions that rely heavily on federal grants, primarily in higher ed. However, when they are ready to move forward, our win rates are very strong, and we're excited by the long-term opportunity ahead. \r\nAcross all of these industries, we're delivering innovation that's changing how work gets done, and the market is taking notice. Gartner just named Workday a leader in 3 Magic Quadrants, including Cloud ERP for Service-Centric Enterprises, Cloud HCM Suites for 1,000+ Employee Enterprises and the first-ever MQ for Cloud ERP Finance, giving us the highest placement for both Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision.\r\nIf you joined us at Workday Rising, you saw how our organic innovation is only accelerating. We introduced new Illuminate agents that tackle some of the toughest challenges at work from performance reviews and workforce planning to financial close. These purpose-built agents are powered by our unmatched HR and financial data and context, which is what makes them highly accurate, actionable and trusted. And now we have more than 150 customers, including Target, Accenture and Netflix using our agents and Agent System of Record in early access. At the same time, we're opening up our platform so customers and partners can create their own AI-powered apps and agents with Workday Build. And with Workday Data Cloud, along with our partners, including Databricks, Salesforce, Snowflake and now Google Cloud, customers can unlock even more insight and value from their Workday data.\r\nWe're also accelerating our innovation through strategic acquisitions. We just our closed acquisition of Sana, an AI-native platform with an incredible team. They're going to help us completely reimagine our user experience for the age of AI. Our vision is very simple and straightforward, make Workday the new front door to work by bringing together enterprise knowledge, AI agents and all the HR and finance processes our customers run every day. This will make it easier than ever to find answers, take action and learn right in Workday. Customer feedback on this vision has been absolutely incredible and Sana Learn brings hyper-personalized skill development and AI-generated content creation to Workday Learning. I can't wait for our customers to get their hands on it. \r\nWe're not stopping there. Last week, we announced the intent to acquire Pipedream, a low-code integration platform for AI agents with more than 3,000 prebuilt connectors to the world's most widely used business applications, like Asana, Jira and Slack. When you combine that reach with Workday's trusted data, deep business context and the capabilities from Sana and Flowise, our agents move from surfacing insights to truly getting work done. So hopefully, you're seeing a theme here. While other vendors confuse the market with thousands of overlapping, general-purpose agents, we're focused on what we do best, and that is building powerful agents for HR and finance that deliver real ROI and measurable business value.\r\nTurning to international. We delivered solid performance across EMEA, APAC and Japan in Q3. We just wrapped up our largest EMEA Rising yet. There, we announced the new Workday EU Sovereign Cloud, which will let customers run our AI-powered HR and finance solutions entirely within the EU, keeping their data local, secure and fully controlled. Also in Q3, we established a new AI Centre of Excellence in Dublin, which is one of our major R&D hubs, and we announced a new office in Dubai. A few of the great wins we had across EMEA in Q3 included Bayer, ING Bank and Tandem Bank. APAC also had a strong quarter, with wins at Genesis Energy, DBS Bank and MGM Grand Paradise. And we continued to build on our success in Japan with new and expanded relationships with Pioneer Corporation, Hoshino Resorts and Eisai.\r\nOur partners continue to play a critical role in our success. Once again, in Q3, more than 20% of our net new ACV was sourced from partners, a testament to the strength of our ecosystem. In Q3, we brought on new Workday Wellness partners including Chime, Spring Health and Strada to expand the value we deliver to our joint customers. We also expanded our partnership with Microsoft to help joint customers securely manage their people and agents across both of our platforms. We're living in a new era of work, powered by AI and built on trust. And Workday is made for this moment. The momentum in our business and the energy I'm seeing across our customer community gives me a ton of confidence in what's ahead. A huge thank you to our global workmates, our customers and our partners for helping us deliver another solid quarter. As we head into Q4, we're focused on finishing strong and setting ourselves up for an even more impactful FY '27.\r\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Zane."

      "text": "Thanks, Carl, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. Our Q3 results were driven by continued progress across several key growth initiatives, as we accelerate innovation throughout the platform and bring exciting AI solutions to market.\r\nTurning to results. Subscription revenue in the third quarter was $2.244 billion, up 15%. Professional services revenue was $188 million, resulting in total revenue of $2.432 billion, growth of 13%. U.S. revenue in Q3 totaled $1.825 billion, up 12%. International revenue totaled $607 million, up 13%. 12-month subscription revenue backlog, or cRPO, was $8.21 billion at the end of Q3, increasing 17.6%. We closed the Paradox acquisition in the quarter, which added over a point to cRPO growth, and was not included in our backlog guidance. Excluding Paradox, cRPO came in slightly above the high end of our outlook. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $25.96 billion, up 17%, and gross revenue retention rates remained healthy at 97%.\r\nNon-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $692 million, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 28.5%. We remain focused on making targeted investments to support long-term growth. This includes increasing our AI talent, both organically and inorganically, entering new markets such as the Middle East and India and investing in the medium enterprise. While we make these investments, we also continue to drive efficiencies as we scale the business globally.\r\nQ3 operating cash flow was $588 million, growth of 45%, in line with our expectations. As we discussed at our recent financial Analyst Day, we intend to accelerate the pace of our buyback. We made good progress in Q3, repurchasing $803 million of our shares during the quarter and $1.4 billion year-to-date. We plan to repurchase an additional $3.6 billion through the end of FY '27, leading to $5 billion in total repurchases. As of October 31, we had $4.4 billion remaining under our current authorization. We ended the quarter with $6.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. Our headcount as of October 31 stood at 20,588 workmates around the globe, including roughly 600 workmates from the Paradox acquisition.\r\nNow turning to guidance. For Q4, we expect subscription revenue of $2.355 billion, growth of 15%, which includes revenue from the Sana acquisition and the expected delivery on the first phase of the DIA contract. We expect FY '26 subscription revenue of $8.828 billion, growth of 14%. Our Q4 subscription revenue guidance is consistent with our view from last quarter excluding the expected contribution from Sana. While we did see some impact in Fed and SLED tied to fiscal funding, this was offset by strong execution across the portfolio, including the Paradox acquisition. We expect cRPO to increase between 15% and 16% in Q4. This includes approximately 0.25 point of expected growth from the Sana acquisition, or about $20 million. And over 1 point of impact from tenants, which we begin to lap in Q1.\r\nFor Q4, we expect professional services revenue of $168 million. And for the full year, we expect it to be $715 million. We are executing well against our efficiency goals and expect a non-GAAP operating margin of at least 28.5% for Q4 and approximately 29% for the full year. We're optimistic about the AI-driven growth investments we are making and have ample capacity to continue to invest while we drive further efficiencies, consistent with the framework from our financial Analyst Day.\r\nWe expect GAAP operating margins to be approximately 19 and 21 points lower than our Q4 and full year FY '26 non-GAAP operating margins, respectively. The FY '26 non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 19%. We are increasing our FY '26 operating cash flow outlook to $2.90 billion, and we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $200 million, resulting in free cash flow of $2.70 billion, growth of 23%.\r\nLooking beyond this year, as we shared at our recent financial Analyst Day, we are targeting a subscription revenue CAGR of 12% to 15% through FY '28, along with continued margin expansion on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. For FY '27 specifically, we continue to expect subscription revenue growth of approximately 13%, also consistent with the view we shared in September at our Analyst Day. We are confident in this growth rate based on the momentum we see across the business as reflected in our Q3 performance as well as our Q4 cRPO guidance. We are optimistic about our growth initiatives and our recent acquisitions and look forward to updating you with formal guidance for FY '27 next quarter.\r\nWe currently expect our Q1 FY '27 subscription revenue growth to be approximately 14% year-over-year and flat sequentially, reflecting typical seasonality from Q4 as well as the expected revenue from DIA in Q4, which doesn't extend into Q1. We believe that the completion of this first phase sets us up for a larger opportunity with the DIA and the broader defense and intelligence communities. We remain on track and confident in our ability to achieve the financial framework we laid out at our Analyst Day back in September, including subscription revenue growth, non-GAAP margins and stock-based compensation. \r\nIn closing, I'd like to thank our workmates, customers and partners around the globe that helped deliver this quarter's results. We enter Q4 well positioned to close the year with strength and remain focused on our long-term opportunity of driving durable growth while expanding operating margins.\r\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to begin Q&A."

Carl, we're hearing some feedback that the venture-backed vibe coding startups have started seeing a slowdown, or at least some of them have or elevated churn. And it's happening because companies are finding it's pretty difficult to operationalize them and put them into production use. I'm wondering if you're seeing any signs of some of that novelty wearing off for those third-party vibe coding products. And if so, do you see any accelerated adoption of Workday Extend where presumably they'd have all the security and all the other infrastructure already in place?"

      "text": "Yes. Mark, thanks for the question. And before I answer, I just wanted to say the following, Q3, Mark, was another solid quarter for Workday reflecting in the strength. And as I always like to say, the diversity and durability of our business. Our customers are seeing clear ROI from Workday, and they're engaging more than ever, and we had more than 1 billion AI actions year-to-date and it's only growing faster and faster. We feel really good about the momentum of the business as we head into Q4 and into FY '27. And I'm truly grateful for all the work, both our partners and our workmates have done to get us to this point in the year. It's been a really good year for us so far.\r\nAnd Mark, I really appreciate your question. It's similar to what Kash asked last quarter when he talked about all of this potential disruption coming from these AI startups to more mature and larger SaaS companies like Workday. And at the time, I said I thought it was a completely overblown narrative, and I thought it was flat out wrong. And quite frankly, fast forwarding 90 days, I think that's playing out exactly like we thought it would. When I spend time with CXOs around the world at both customers and prospects, they talk about 3 things that's hindering or slowing down enterprise adoption of AI: It is data quality, it's data integrity and it's security. \r\nAnd by the way, none of these are an issue for Workday. As you know, we have one of the largest and cleanest and most highly curated data sets for HR and finance in the industry. No questions asked. And we have the security, compliance and controls in place because today we onboard a large portion of the world's workforce and we can apply those same process and procedures to your workforce of the future, both human and digital. \r\nAnd when we spend time with our customers, while maybe they're enamored with these point solutions, they're ultimately coming back to the vendors they trust who have been in their infrastructure for a long time, has that data set and drives real business outcomes. The narrative we've been hearing the last couple quarters is changing and it's coming back to those who are highly penetrated in the enterprise, already providing value and are deeply trusted by our customers. So I agree with what you're seeing. We're seeing it, we're hearing it, and it's reflected in customers continuing to bet on Workday for their future."

And I know you guys commented that your customers are growing, headcount slowly right now. What are the mechanisms that you guys have if a customer were to have to lay off people to be able to keep growing ACV with them? Obviously, cross-sell, upsell, are there discounts that go away? I just -- can you explain that a little bit? Because I think people believe there's sort of a linear relationship between number of -- on a per seat basis. And I realize it's probably a little bit more complicated that, especially at the high end of your business."

And yes, in my prepared remarks, I once again wanted to articulate and share that on a net basis, the headcount of our customer base is up year-over-year. So while there are some layoffs out there, we're still growing headcount across our customer base. And what we're doing, you said it, we are selling back into our base, and we're focused not on just seats, but actually revenue per seat. And what we have now more than ever is we have a whole bunch of new solutions, both organically innovated solutions and solutions that we got through acquisition that we're selling back into our customer base, whether it's Evisort, whether it's HiredScore, now it's Sana, now it's Paradox, now it's Flowise. \r\nWe have so much more to sell back into our customer base, and that drives strength for us and offsets any potential impact we might see from headcount reductions in our customers. Also, our customers do true ups with us both annually on their headcount, and we do have floors and minimums that the customer can bring their headcount down, and that gives us some protection. But overall, we're still seeing growth in headcount year-over-year, and we're selling just a lot more back into our customer base because they're betting on our platform, and they're using us as a consolidation platform across all of their point solutions to drive a better total cost of ownership."

Carl, I think on the call you said 1.5 points of growth in ARR already coming from those AI solutions. Can you give us any rules of thumb that you're starting to see that could help us maybe model this out a little bit in terms of what type of uplift do you see on a typical deal or for a typical customer when they're buying the AI solutions? Or how broad is this? Like what percentage of your customer base has already bought into the solutions and how far do we have to go? Just something to help us extrapolate that early success into what this might look like in a year from now or 2 years from now."

Our AI solutions are adding 1.5 points of growth to our ARR, and we're also trying to give you some color specifically on the strength of our AI solution. So for example, 75% of our new sales included in AI solution, 35% of our sales back to our customer base includes AI. So we're seeing really good traction, and we're seeing really good early indications of demand from some of our acquired companies like Sana and Paradox. \r\nSo overall, our AI momentum is as strong, if not stronger, than ever, and it's being reflected in how our customers are buying our product, both at time of new sales as well as our ability to sell back into our customer base. So I couldn't be more excited about where we're at. Things like Evisort had a record quarter. We're seeing an acceleration in growth in Evisort. In Extend Pro, we call that out, it once again grew 50% year-over-year. And then when we sell back into our customers, for example, when we sell something like a higher score recruiting agent, it's a significant uptick over what we would sell our standard recruiting SKU for."

So first, as you know, we've closed the Paradox acquisition in October. And within 2 weeks, we were already off and selling it. And it had a small impact in the quarter, a few million dollars over a 2-week period just by our sales force going out and selling that into the market. I will tell you, coming out of Rising EMEA, the demand and excitement for Paradox in being a Workday product and selling it on our paper was very, very strong. On Sana, similar feedback from our customers. They see this as an extremely powerful AI solution across multiple dimensions, starting with Learning. \r\nWe can now sell their AI learning platform back into and on top of our 4,000 customers that have Workday Learning today. And then obviously we're going to refresh our UI/UX, leveraging the Sana platform going forward. So the early indication specifically on these 2 recent acquired companies is as strong as anything we've seen when we acquire a company. And maybe, Gerrit, you can talk specifically about Sana because that one is off the charts right now from a demand and from an excitement from our customers."

So very natural for us to bring this to our customers, of which we have a very scaled base of Workday Learning customers which are using Sana and are excited about Sana as a learning AI experience platform on top of that, very natural, very immediate interest. And secondly, what Carl has mentioned, Sana is also now being developed into the leading UI experience for Workday. So you can think about a complete conversational experience around the Workday platform. Workday being the innovation leader and our customers are tremendously excited about the massive simplification that brings to them. \r\nAnd if you imagine every employee having access to HR and finance AI at scale, what that means in cost reduction. On the other side, you can see what drives that interest. And thirdly, Sana goes much more beyond that. And I would recommend you look at the big picture with also Pipedream, adding 3,000 connectors to the Sana platform, which now allows our customers to take Sana knowledge management actions in Workday and the actions that Pipedream adds to really drive enterprise-wide AI transformation with that model. And we see very strong customer interest across all of those 3 vectors."

So we're still driving that within the framework and very pleased with the progress we're making there."

Number one, we can sell it back into our customers, right, as an attachment to our already strong recruiting platform including something like HiredScore. Now we have Paradox. So we have the industry-leading AI recruiting platform out there today. At the same time, this is now a new product that is a land-only product for our sales force who can now go and sell Paradox, not only on top of Workday or back into our installed base, but also into our competitors' environment. \r\nIn fact, a significant portion of their existing customers aren't Workday today and we're going to continue to leverage that go-to-market model, so it gives us another land product without someone having to decide completely on Workday, HR or finance. They can go just with Paradox, and I've seen that come up multiple times just in the first 60 days of us having this great asset."

We feel very confident. I mean, obviously, as always, cRPO, the number of factors, both the net new business as well as renewal activity and just the volume that you get in any particular quarter. So we think we've got great strength heading into the fourth quarter. We've got terrific coverage on our expected subscription growth heading into next year, which I alluded to as you think about even between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So no, we feel good about the cRPO growth as well as the coverage. So net-net, we feel good even on a sequential basis. I did call out how much of that was Sana as well, which is a very small impact on revenue for the fourth quarter."

But again, there are other variables within the timing on renewal activity and things like that. One other call out I'll make, if you're trying to understand sort of those components between the organic and the inorganic component in the fourth quarter is, I'd say, that both Sana and Paradox contribute roughly 1.5 points to our Q4 subscription revenue growth. So just to help you contextualize that, I mean, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, absent Sana, we believe our Q4 was consistent with our view just a quarter ago. So we feel great about the activity there. But that helps you understand sort of the components of Q4 and the cRPO growth heading into the quarter and into next year."

So we have been doing this at Workday extremely successfully and now we are just taking the next steps in leading AI technology to help our customers become truly AI-driven enterprises. And specifically, the vectors of our innovation is with Paradox and in a bigger picture frontline, fully bringing AI automation to the entire hiring journey. \r\nIf you put that together with our recruiting agent, Paradox as a candidate engagement agent in connection with each other, it basically builds the AI-driven talent suite. What they're doing with Sana is we're acquiring leading knowledge management in a leading agent orchestrator to be the AI experience layer across Workday. So very important, when we think about AI adoption that our conviction is AI is going to be the new UI and that all of the legacy vendors who are not having leading experiences are going to get relocated through that. \r\nAnd thirdly, what you mentioned about Pipedream, right? Our ambition and our customers' requirements are actually taking us much broader than Workday is in finance and HR and really looking for enterprise-wide orchestration. We think about it as an enterprise AI fabric that we are creating through Pipedream with Sana as the experience layer on top, built on top of Workday's business process platform."

We have the data, right? We have the context of the data, and we're built in the business workflow. And our customers are saying, time and time again, they no longer want to even evaluate point AI solutions. They want to do it on the back of a trusted platform. Therefore, we go and we get something like Paradox, we get Pipedream, we get Sana, last year, Evisort. Before that, we get HiredScore. \r\nAnd it's not just our customers who are saying they believe in our platform, it's partners. To your point, we're partnering with Microsoft. So as they start to build agents, they see the most secure, reliable and trusted way to onboard their agents is through Workday in our Agent System of Record because no one has more experience in onboarding employees than Workday and now we're taking that to the digital worker as well."

And secondly, we are specifically innovating around Workday GO with specific AI models. Think about the whole configuration, administration, management of the system, setup complexity. We are working and announced a new deployment agent which already is slashing deployment time and complexity down by a significant degree. \r\nIt's a key investment theme for us and just connecting it back to the broader partner network, specifically with Workday GO to new managed services like payroll, we are working on payroll AI that is securely being connected into our ASO with our partners that are providing these services to also drive payroll automation, payroll simplification, benefits management across the Workday GO global partner network. And that's specifically being created all from that angle to make the mid-market customer run at the scale of Workday, but with unmatched simplicity."

We now offer Global Payroll, if a customer wants it. By the way, if they don't want to use a managed Global Payroll service from Workday, they can bring their own payroll. We have a partner network that's going to help us take Workday GO to the market around the world and resell it on our behalf, and then we have that AI deployment agent. Also included in Workday GO is a payroll agent to help people simplify how they're managing their payroll activity across the enterprise. Workday GO, I will tell you, is on fire. People are excited about it, and people are leaning into Workday down market as we aggressively go attack that market segment around the world."

So if you look at the acquired revenue, I'd say it probably contributes approximately 1 point into next year. But as you can tell, there's a lot more that we're doing around it and the whole portfolio benefits. So it's more -- there's significant synergy, if you want to think about it more broadly. \r\nBut on the acquired revenue, I'd call it sort of roughly 1 point heading into next year. And then we have a high bar on M&A. And as we've talked about all along, I mean we've kept consistent in thinking about the technology, the culture, the people and how they integrate either -- whether it's through adjacencies or tuck-ins or for different reasons. So I'd say no change in how we think about that and no change in how we incorporate that inorganic growth."

We've historically been talking about our performance in Europe when we talked about our international results. But this quarter, we're talking about it in the context of Europe, APAC and Japan because all 3 delivered solid results in the quarter. \r\nI think that's driven by 2 things. Number one, on the product side, we continue to internationalize and localize our product to serve all of these markets. Number two, we're leveraging a strong network of partners out there around the world to enter these markets. And the third is we continue to attract great talent to lead our Workday efforts around the world.

I wonder -- it's clear that you guys are seeing a bit of -- quite a bit of AI momentum, right? And I agree with you, the AI disruption risk seems to be little overstated. But I think we can look at the numbers and say that AI, there's some tangible contribution. Your backlog, 12-month backlog growth rate, although it did include some acquisitions, it did do a little better. \r\nAnd these acquisitions, the anniversary, they are growing very nicely, that should lead to an acceleration in the organic growth rate as well. But that effect, conceptually, you put your thinking hats off or thinking hats on, sorry, down with the flu, a little too discombobulated. If you were to rebuild a company on an AI native stack -- an HCM company AI native stack today, what would that functionality be able to do? That is what would that stack be able to do that could be disruptive that you can do as a Workday customer with the tools that Workday is providing, be it organically or through these combinations of acquisitions?"

      "text": "Kash, thank you for ending on such a beautiful question. So let's just look at the core principles of building AI systems at scale, right? And let's just look at what it really is. The first thing that you need is a vast set of data which basically describes the domain, the domain of finance, the domain of HR. And you need a vast set of data that basically codifies how the data is being used, right? That is ingredient number one. If you look at AI at scale, it's about learning and using patterns. So you need to have that global database. \r\nSecondly, you need to have strong semantics and clarity about what data we present. So you need to have both a data model that defines what data element represents what entity in the business? What do they relate on? And what are the rules for these business entities because data is not created equal, right? They have integrity, they have meaning, they have purpose. And you need to have a business process system which now basically tells you how to activate this data in a way so it can drive towards a business outcome. Even more so you need to have clarity on what that business outcome is. Those are the basics of building a successful AI solution. \r\nNow take a look at Workday. We are the only scale SaaS vendor born in the cloud with a consolidated data set. Our 50 million to 75 million users that we have contribute to a uniform data model which is completely clean. We have all of the process data in a form of business process description codifying 70,000 core business process archetypes, which are instantiated across all of our customers and thousands of variations. We have ample data of usage and how these processes are being used in the business. \r\nAnd most importantly, the domain knowledge to specify what are the target outcomes to drive. So if you were to build a system that is built for enterprise AI at scale, it would look like Workday. And what we are doing right now, specifically is that we are opening up our core and basically integrate reasoning models and AI systems to automate these processes. We lay Asana on top to lead the experience, AI innovation on top of that. And if you look at all of that in aggregate, it truly is the AI stack for the enterprise of the future."

[Operator Instructions]\r\nI will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\n## Justin Furby (Executives)\nThank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Carl Eschenbach, our CEO; Zane Rowe, our CFO; and Gerrit Kazmaier, our President, Product & Technology. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast.\r\nBefore we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today, and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors in documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2025 annual report on Form 10-K for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\r\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results.

I'm pleased to report that Workday delivered solid Q3 results, with 15% subscription revenue growth and 28.5% non-GAAP operating margin. Our teams executed well, and our value proposition is clearly resonating with organizations around the world. I've been on the road a lot lately, meeting with our customers and prospects, and they're all saying the same thing. They see the potential of AI, but they're stuck with disconnected systems, bad data and closed platforms. That's where Workday gives them the ultimate advantage by unifying HR and finance on one intelligent platform, we deliver business-ready AI that helps organizations adapt quickly, make better decisions and deliver outcomes that truly matter.\r\nNow let's turn to our customer highlights for the quarter. In Q3, we continued to grow across industries, segments and geographies. In HCM, we added new customers, including Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Fuji Electric and The Magnum Ice Cream Company. Core Financials also performed well, driving strong full suite adoption. In fact, half of all net new global deals in Q3 included both HR and finance, with key wins such as Ardent Health, Kelly Services and Specialized. We also expanded with customers such as CommonSpirit Health, Levi Strauss and Novartis. And consistent with recent quarters, our customers' headcount levels continued to grow modestly. And our momentum isn't just from large enterprises. Workday GO is helping us drive strong new customer growth and continued ACV momentum in the medium enterprise. \r\nJust last week, we announced a major expansion of Workday GO, including Global Payroll, an expanded partner network and a new AI powered deployment agent that can cut implementation time by up to 25%. Customers of all sizes and industries tell us that an investment in Workday is an investment in their AI strategy. More than 75% of our core customers are using Workday Illuminate AI, driving well over 1 billion AI actions on the Workday platform this year alone and adoption keeps growing. More than 3/4 of net new deals and 35% of customer expansions included one or more AI products.\r\nAmong the standouts, Evisort delivered another record quarter, and Extend Pro grew net new ACV by more than 50% year-over-year. Altogether, our AI products added more than 1.5 points of ARR growth this quarter. That doesn't include Paradox, which we closed in Q3 and is already off to a strong start. And with the rollout of Flex Credits early next year, we're making it even easier for our customers to adopt our AI and platform innovation.\r\nOur customer footprint spans every major industry. Tech and media and financial services, 2 of our $1 billion industries were standout performers in the quarter. And in Q3, health care became our sixth industry to exceed $1 billion in ARR, with strategic wins like Ardent Health, Ascendiun and Northeast Georgia Medical Center. One of my favorites this quarter was a major win back at a large U.S. health insurer. They were a long-time Workday customer that moved to a competitor several years ago and quickly regretted it. Now they're back with Workday and choosing our full suite with a 10-year commitment.\r\nOur public sector momentum was also strong in Q3. And despite the weeks-long government shutdown, engagement across federal agencies remained high. The Department of Energy's successful go-live in Q3 is a great example. They're the first cabinet-level agency to bring their core HR systems into our FedRAMP-authorized cloud. We're also nearing completion of the first phase of our work with the DIA. This opens up an important long-term opportunity, both with the agency and across the intelligence community and Department of War.\r\nIn SLED, we welcomed new customers including the County of San Luis Obispo, the City of Concord and Cleveland State University, and we expanded with Cornell University, which added both core financials and student. While we had a number of successes across our Fed, SLED and health care teams, we also saw some isolated impacts within institutions that rely heavily on federal grants, primarily in higher ed. However, when they are ready to move forward, our win rates are very strong, and we're excited by the long-term opportunity ahead. \r\nAcross all of these industries, we're delivering innovation that's changing how work gets done, and the market is taking notice. Gartner just named Workday a leader in 3 Magic Quadrants, including Cloud ERP for Service-Centric Enterprises, Cloud HCM Suites for 1,000+ Employee Enterprises and the first-ever MQ for Cloud ERP Finance, giving us the highest placement for both Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision.\r\nIf you joined us at Workday Rising, you saw how our organic innovation is only accelerating. We introduced new Illuminate agents that tackle some of the toughest challenges at work from performance reviews and workforce planning to financial close. These purpose-built agents are powered by our unmatched HR and financial data and context, which is what makes them highly accurate, actionable and trusted. And now we have more than 150 customers, including Target, Accenture and Netflix using our agents and Agent System of Record in early access. At the same time, we're opening up our platform so customers and partners can create their own AI-powered apps and agents with Workday Build. And with Workday Data Cloud, along with our partners, including Databricks, Salesforce, Snowflake and now Google Cloud, customers can unlock even more insight and value from their Workday data.\r\nWe're also accelerating our innovation through strategic acquisitions. We just our closed acquisition of Sana, an AI-native platform with an incredible team. They're going to help us completely reimagine our user experience for the age of AI. Our vision is very simple and straightforward, make Workday the new front door to work by bringing together enterprise knowledge, AI agents and all the HR and finance processes our customers run every day. This will make it easier than ever to find answers, take action and learn right in Workday. Customer feedback on this vision has been absolutely incredible and Sana Learn brings hyper-personalized skill development and AI-generated content creation to Workday Learning. I can't wait for our customers to get their hands on it. \r\nWe're not stopping there. Last week, we announced the intent to acquire Pipedream, a low-code integration platform for AI agents with more than 3,000 prebuilt connectors to the world's most widely used business applications, like Asana, Jira and Slack. When you combine that reach with Workday's trusted data, deep business context and the capabilities from Sana and Flowise, our agents move from surfacing insights to truly getting work done. So hopefully, you're seeing a theme here. While other vendors confuse the market with thousands of overlapping, general-purpose agents, we're focused on what we do best, and that is building powerful agents for HR and finance that deliver real ROI and measurable business value.\r\nTurning to international. We delivered solid performance across EMEA, APAC and Japan in Q3. We just wrapped up our largest EMEA Rising yet. There, we announced the new Workday EU Sovereign Cloud, which will let customers run our AI-powered HR and finance solutions entirely within the EU, keeping their data local, secure and fully controlled. Also in Q3, we established a new AI Centre of Excellence in Dublin, which is one of our major R&D hubs, and we announced a new office in Dubai. A few of the great wins we had across EMEA in Q3 included Bayer, ING Bank and Tandem Bank. APAC also had a strong quarter, with wins at Genesis Energy, DBS Bank and MGM Grand Paradise. And we continued to build on our success in Japan with new and expanded relationships with Pioneer Corporation, Hoshino Resorts and Eisai.\r\nOur partners continue to play a critical role in our success. Once again, in Q3, more than 20% of our net new ACV was sourced from partners, a testament to the strength of our ecosystem. In Q3, we brought on new Workday Wellness partners including Chime, Spring Health and Strada to expand the value we deliver to our joint customers. We also expanded our partnership with Microsoft to help joint customers securely manage their people and agents across both of our platforms. We're living in a new era of work, powered by AI and built on trust. And Workday is made for this moment. The momentum in our business and the energy I'm seeing across our customer community gives me a ton of confidence in what's ahead. A huge thank you to our global workmates, our customers and our partners for helping us deliver another solid quarter. As we head into Q4, we're focused on finishing strong and setting ourselves up for an even more impactful FY '27.\r\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Zane.\n\n## Zane Rowe (Executives)\nThanks, Carl, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. Our Q3 results were driven by continued progress across several key growth initiatives, as we accelerate innovation throughout the platform and bring exciting AI solutions to market.\r\nTurning to results. Subscription revenue in the third quarter was $2.244 billion, up 15%. Professional services revenue was $188 million, resulting in total revenue of $2.432 billion, growth of 13%. U.S. revenue in Q3 totaled $1.825 billion, up 12%. International revenue totaled $607 million, up 13%. 12-month subscription revenue backlog, or cRPO, was $8.21 billion at the end of Q3, increasing 17.6%. We closed the Paradox acquisition in the quarter, which added over a point to cRPO growth, and was not included in our backlog guidance. Excluding Paradox, cRPO came in slightly above the high end of our outlook. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $25.96 billion, up 17%, and gross revenue retention rates remained healthy at 97%.\r\nNon-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $692 million, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 28.5%. We remain focused on making targeted investments to support long-term growth. This includes increasing our AI talent, both organically and inorganically, entering new markets such as the Middle East and India and investing in the medium enterprise. While we make these investments, we also continue to drive efficiencies as we scale the business globally.\r\nQ3 operating cash flow was $588 million, growth of 45%, in line with our expectations. As we discussed at our recent financial Analyst Day, we intend to accelerate the pace of our buyback. We made good progress in Q3, repurchasing $803 million of our shares during the quarter and $1.4 billion year-to-date. We plan to repurchase an additional $3.6 billion through the end of FY '27, leading to $5 billion in total repurchases. As of October 31, we had $4.4 billion remaining under our current authorization. We ended the quarter with $6.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. Our headcount as of October 31 stood at 20,588 workmates around the globe, including roughly 600 workmates from the Paradox acquisition.\r\nNow turning to guidance. For Q4, we expect subscription revenue of $2.355 billion, growth of 15%, which includes revenue from the Sana acquisition and the expected delivery on the first phase of the DIA contract. We expect FY '26 subscription revenue of $8.828 billion, growth of 14%. Our Q4 subscription revenue guidance is consistent with our view from last quarter excluding the expected contribution from Sana. While we did see some impact in Fed and SLED tied to fiscal funding, this was offset by strong execution across the portfolio, including the Paradox acquisition. We expect cRPO to increase between 15% and 16% in Q4. This includes approximately 0.25 point of expected growth from the Sana acquisition, or about $20 million. And over 1 point of impact from tenants, which we begin to lap in Q1.\r\nFor Q4, we expect professional services revenue of $168 million. And for the full year, we expect it to be $715 million. We are executing well against our efficiency goals and expect a non-GAAP operating margin of at least 28.5% for Q4 and approximately 29% for the full year. We're optimistic about the AI-driven growth investments we are making and have ample capacity to continue to invest while we drive further efficiencies, consistent with the framework from our financial Analyst Day.\r\nWe expect GAAP operating margins to be approximately 19 and 21 points lower than our Q4 and full year FY '26 non-GAAP operating margins, respectively. The FY '26 non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 19%. We are increasing our FY '26 operating cash flow outlook to $2.90 billion, and we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $200 million, resulting in free cash flow of $2.70 billion, growth of 23%.\r\nLooking beyond this year, as we shared at our recent financial Analyst Day, we are targeting a subscription revenue CAGR of 12% to 15% through FY '28, along with continued margin expansion on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. For FY '27 specifically, we continue to expect subscription revenue growth of approximately 13%, also consistent with the view we shared in September at our Analyst Day. We are confident in this growth rate based on the momentum we see across the business as reflected in our Q3 performance as well as our Q4 cRPO guidance. We are optimistic about our growth initiatives and our recent acquisitions and look forward to updating you with formal guidance for FY '27 next quarter.\r\nWe currently expect our Q1 FY '27 subscription revenue growth to be approximately 14% year-over-year and flat sequentially, reflecting typical seasonality from Q4 as well as the expected revenue from DIA in Q4, which doesn't extend into Q1. We believe that the completion of this first phase sets us up for a larger opportunity with the DIA and the broader defense and intelligence communities. We remain on track and confident in our ability to achieve the financial framework we laid out at our Analyst Day back in September, including subscription revenue growth, non-GAAP margins and stock-based compensation. \r\nIn closing, I'd like to thank our workmates, customers and partners around the globe that helped deliver this quarter's results. We enter Q4 well positioned to close the year with strength and remain focused on our long-term opportunity of driving durable growth while expanding operating margins.\r\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to begin Q&A.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\n\n## Mark Murphy (Analysts)\nI'll add my congrats on a very nice performance. Carl, we're hearing some feedback that the venture-backed vibe coding startups have started seeing a slowdown, or at least some of them have or elevated churn. And it's happening because companies are finding it's pretty difficult to operationalize them and put them into production use. I'm wondering if you're seeing any signs of some of that novelty wearing off for those third-party vibe coding products. And if so, do you see any accelerated adoption of Workday Extend where presumably they'd have all the security and all the other infrastructure already in place?\n\n## Carl Eschenbach (Executives)\nYes. Mark, thanks for the question. And before I answer, I just wanted to say the following, Q3, Mark, was another solid quarter for Workday reflecting in the strength. And as I always like to say, the diversity and durability of our business. Our customers are seeing clear ROI from Workday, and they're engaging more than ever, and we had more than 1 billion AI actions year-to-date and it's only growing faster and faster. We feel really good about the momentum of the business as we head into Q4 and into FY '27. And I'm truly grateful for all the work, both our partners and our workmates have done to get us to this point in the year. It's been a really good year for us so far.\r\nAnd Mark, I really appreciate your question. It's similar to what Kash asked last quarter when he talked about all of this potential disruption coming from these AI startups to more mature and larger SaaS companies like Workday. And at the time, I said I thought it was a completely overblown narrative, and I thought it was flat out wrong. And quite frankly, fast forwarding 90 days, I think that's playing out exactly like we thought it would. When I spend time with CXOs around the world at both customers and prospects, they talk about 3 things that's hindering or slowing down enterprise adoption of AI: It is data quality, it's data integrity and it's security. \r\nAnd by the way, none of these are an issue for Workday. As you know, we have one of the largest and cleanest and most highly curated data sets for HR and finance in the industry. No questions asked. And we have the security, compliance and controls in place because today we onboard a large portion of the world's workforce and we can apply those same process and procedures to your workforce of the future, both human and digital. \r\nAnd when we spend time with our customers, while maybe they're enamored with these point solutions, they're ultimately coming back to the vendors they trust who have been in their infrastructure for a long time, has that data set and drives real business outcomes. The narrative we've been hearing the last couple quarters is changing and it's coming back to those who are highly penetrated in the enterprise, already providing value and are deeply trusted by our customers. So I agree with what you're seeing. We're seeing it, we're hearing it, and it's reflected in customers continuing to bet on Workday for their future.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nOur next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\n\n## S. Kirk Materne (Analysts)\nCongrats on a solid quarter. Carl, the other narrative that often comes up these days is clients see a big customer laying off people. And I know you guys commented that your customers are growing, headcount slowly right now. What are the mechanisms that you guys have if a customer were to have to lay off people to be able to keep growing ACV with them? Obviously, cross-sell, upsell, are there discounts that go away? I just -- can you explain that a little bit? Because I think people believe there's sort of a linear relationship between number of -- on a per seat basis. And I realize it's probably a little bit more complicated that, especially at the high end of your business.\n\n## Carl Eschenbach (Executives)\nThanks, Kirk. I appreciate the question. And yes, in my prepared remarks, I once again wanted to articulate and share that on a net basis, the headcount of our customer base is up year-over-year. So while there are some layoffs out there, we're still growing headcount across our customer base. And what we're doing, you said it, we are selling back into our base, and we're focused not on just seats, but actually revenue per seat. And what we have now more than ever is we have a whole bunch of new solutions, both organically innovated solutions and solutions that we got through acquisition that we're selling back into our customer base, whether it's Evisort, whether it's HiredScore, now it's Sana, now it's Paradox, now it's Flowise. \r\nWe have so much more to sell back into our customer base, and that drives strength for us and offsets any potential impact we might see from headcount reductions in our customers. Also, our customers do true ups with us both annually on their headcount, and we do have floors and minimums that the customer can bring their headcount down, and that gives us some protection. But overall, we're still seeing growth in headcount year-over-year, and we're selling just a lot more back into our customer base because they're betting on our platform, and they're using us as a consolidation platform across all of their point solutions to drive a better total cost of ownership.\n\n## Zane Rowe (Executives)\nKirk, I'd just add, if you look at the aggregate, it is a net positive, but it's not a significant amount of our growth. So there are lots of elements, as Carl alluded to, that go into that growth number, and this is just one of them.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nOur next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\n\n## Keith Weiss (Analysts)\nCongratulations on the solid quarter. I wanted to ask about some of the early success you guys are seeing with your AI solutions. Carl, I think on the call you said 1.5 points of growth in ARR already coming from those AI solutions. Can you give us any rules of thumb that you're starting to see that could help us maybe model this out a little bit in terms of what type of uplift do you see on a typical deal or for a typical customer when they're buying the AI solutions? Or how broad is this? Like what percentage of your customer base has already bought into the solutions and how far do we have to go? Just something to help us extrapolate that early success into what this might look like in a year from now or 2 years from now.\n\n## Carl Eschenbach (Executives)\nYes. Thanks for the question, Keith. And we gave some of these statistics at FAD just 90 days ago. That's why we called out again this quarter. Our AI solutions are adding 1.5 points of growth to our ARR, and we're also trying to give you some color specifically on the strength of our AI solution. So for example, 75% of our new sales included in AI solution, 35% of our sales back to our customer base includes AI. So we're seeing really good traction, and we're seeing really good early indications of demand from some of our acquired companies like Sana and Paradox. \r\nSo overall, our AI momentum is as strong, if not stronger, than ever, and it's being reflected in how our customers are buying our product, both at time of new sales as well as our ability to sell back into our customer base. So I couldn't be more excited about where we're at. Things like Evisort had a record quarter. We're seeing an acceleration in growth in Evisort. In Extend Pro, we call that out, it once again grew 50% year-over-year. And then when we sell back into our customers, for example, when we sell something like a higher score recruiting agent, it's a significant uptick over what we would sell our standard recruiting SKU for.\n\n## Keith Weiss (Analysts)\nGot it. Any sense on how much of an uplift it is versus the standard?\n\n## Carl Eschenbach (Executives)\nYes. On, for example, on HiredScore, for every dollar of recruiting we sell, we sell about $2.50 of HiredScore on top of it.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nOur next question is from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.\n\n## Michael Turrin (Analysts)\nI appreciate you asking or appreciate you taking the question and congrats on the results as well. I guess just a 2-parter for me. I guess first, just -- I wanted to zoom in on some of the early feedback around Paradox and Sana. Just what you're hearing from customers coming out of rising and if that can help the Workday business model continue to evolve towards just some of the questions around AI and agentic capabilities that you're offering alongside the Flex Credits program. And then, Zane, maybe just coming out Rising, an update on how you're thinking about the trade-offs between growth and margin, given some of the recent additions in the product portfolio and some of that feedback there as well.\n\n## Carl Eschenbach (Executives)\nYes. So maybe I'll start and then I'll kick it over to both Gerrit and Zane specifically to follow-up on the questions. So first, as you know, we've closed the Paradox acquisition in October. And within 2 weeks, we were already off and selling it. And it had a small impact in the quarter, a few million dollars over a 2-week period just by our sales force going out and selling that into the market. I will tell you, coming out of Rising EMEA, the demand and excitement for Paradox in being a Workday product and selling it on our paper was very, very strong. On Sana, similar feedback from our customers. They see this as an extremely powerful AI solution across multiple dimensions, starting with Learning. \r\nWe can now sell their AI learning platform back into and on top of our 4,000 customers that have Workday Learning today. And then obviously we're going to refresh our UI/UX, leveraging the Sana platform going forward. So the early indication specifically on these 2 recent acquired companies is as strong as anything we've seen when we acquire a company. And maybe, Gerrit, you can talk specifically about Sana because that one is off the charts right now from a demand and from an excitement from our customers.\n\n## Gerrit Kazmaier (Executives)\nYes. And as Carl has said, we are seeing tremendous interest around the 3 main vectors of Sana. One, as Carl has said, it's the leading AI learning platform. So very natural for us to bring this to our customers, of which we have a very scaled base of Workday Learning customers which are using Sana and are excited about Sana as a learning AI experience platform on top of that, very natural, very immediate interest. And secondly, what Carl has mentioned, Sana is also now being developed into the leading UI experience for Workday. So you can think about a complete conversational experience around the Workday platform. Workday being the innovation leader and our customers are tremendously excited about the massive simplification that brings to them. \r\nAnd if you imagine every employee having access to HR and finance AI at scale, what that means in cost reduction. On the other side, you can see what drives that interest. And thirdly, Sana goes much more beyond that. And I would recommend you look at the big picture with also Pipedream, adding 3,000 connectors to the Sana platform, which now allows our customers to take Sana knowledge management actions in Workday and the actions that Pipedream adds to really drive enterprise-wide AI transformation with that model. And we see very strong customer interest across all of those 3 vectors.\n\n## Zane Rowe (Executives)\nMichael, this is Zane. I'll just add. As you can hear between Carl and Gerrit, we're thrilled with the early success that we're seeing from both Paradox and Sana. So as it relates to our financial framework, I'd say no change at all. We continue to invest in AI both organically and inorganically and are pleased with the investments we're making there and at the same time recognizing the efficiencies and scale that we're driving across the business. So we're still driving that within the framework and very pleased with the progress we're making there.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nOur next question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\n\n## Brent Thill (Analysts)\nJust with Paradox. I know that SAP and other ERP installed bases are using that. Is your vision that you can sell this anywhere, that you're going to be agnostic to whatever platform is running the back? How are you thinking about that from a go-to-market?\n\n## Carl Eschenbach (Executives)\nYes. Thanks, Brent. We are super excited about the go-to-market capabilities we have around Paradox. Number one, we can sell it back into our customers, right, as an attachment to our already strong recruiting platform including something like HiredScore. Now we have Paradox. So we have the industry-leading AI recruiting platform out there today. At the same time, this is now a new product that is a land-only product for our sales force who can now go and sell Paradox, not only on top of Workday or back into our installed base, but also into our competitors' environment. \r\nIn fact, a significant portion of their existing customers aren't Workday today and we're going to continue to leverage that go-to-market model, so it gives us another land product without someone having to decide completely on Workday, HR or finance. They can go just with Paradox, and I've seen that come up multiple times just in the first 60 days of us having this great asset.\n\n## Brent Thill (Analysts)\nOkay. Zane, real quick, just on cRPO, is there anything to consider in the guide that you're maybe highlighting as a headwind, tailwind? Any change to how you're thinking about that in terms of how we should think about modeling it?\n\n## Zane Rowe (Executives)\nNo, I mean I think it's fairly clean, Brent. I mean obviously we feel good about what we saw in the third quarter. I mentioned that Paradox was over 1 point of that. We feel very confident. I mean, obviously, as always, cRPO, the number of factors, both the net new business as well as renewal activity and just the volume that you get in any particular quarter. So we think we've got great strength heading into the fourth quarter. We've got terrific coverage on our expected subscription growth heading into next year, which I alluded to as you think about even between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So no, we feel good about the cRPO growth as well as the coverage. So net-net, we feel good even on a sequential basis. I did call out how much of that was Sana as well, which is a very small impact on revenue for the fourth quarter.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nOur next question is from Karl Keirstead with UBS.\n\n## Karl Keirstead (Analysts)\nZane, maybe we can just continue that conversation. So if we try to take your 4Q cRPO 15% to 16% and normalize it by deducting maybe some of the onetime stuff. So just so I've got the thinking right, maybe 1 point year-over-year from the tenant contracts, maybe 1 point year-over-year from Paradox and 1/4 from Sana. So maybe 2.25 points from more unusual stuff to back out to get to more normalized. Is that roughly the right math?\n\n## Zane Rowe (Executives)\nYes, Karl, I mean, there are lots of things you can sort of move around within that cRPO growth. I mean I think you've got it sort of generally in line. But again, there are other variables within the timing on renewal activity and things like that. One other call out I'll make, if you're trying to understand sort of those components between the organic and the inorganic component in the fourth quarter is, I'd say, that both Sana and Paradox contribute roughly 1.5 points to our Q4 subscription revenue growth. So just to help you contextualize that, I mean, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, absent Sana, we believe our Q4 was consistent with our view just a quarter ago. So we feel great about the activity there. But that helps you understand sort of the components of Q4 and the cRPO growth heading into the quarter and into next year.\n\n## Karl Keirstead (Analysts)\nOkay. And maybe just in the spirit of a follow-up on 4Q, this time on sub revs, it sounds like it's embedding a view of reaching those DIA go-live milestones. I'm assuming that given that there's just 2 months left in the fiscal year, you and Carl are feeling pretty good about that. Obviously, the shutdown, I suspect didn't help, but can you just maybe express confidence level in hitting those DIA go-lives?\n\n## Zane Rowe (Executives)\nYes, it's a great call out. We're highly confident. Just to give you a sense of size on that one, it's a roughly $15 million in the fourth quarter. We feel great about the progress we've been making all year. We're tracking it very closely and it's embedded in our forecast in -- for the fourth quarter.\n\n## Carl Eschenbach (Executives)\nYes. Yes, Karl, we're tracking really well towards the contract requirements that give us that $15 million in Q4, and we're already talking to them about an expansion of taking that platform to the next level, which opens up a whole bunch of different opportunities across a broader Department of Defense or Department of War. We're really excited about the momentum we're seeing with the federal government in this DIA project, or the first phase of it, is really opening us up to a great opportunity going forward. And as I said, we're already negotiating a follow-on to take that platform to the next level with further security requirements they're asking us for.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nOur next question is from Brad Sills with Bank of America.\n\n## Bradley Sills (Analysts)\nIt's clear from all the announcements and what we saw out of the conference was that you're really going for with AI, the Sana acquisition, Paradox, more recently Pipedream that partnership with Microsoft. I mean, how should we read that? Should we think of this as kind of a year where you're building the foundation for AI and agents and that 1.5 points of growth coming from AI goes materially higher perhaps in fiscal '28 or is this more of a '27 event just given where you are with all the great innovation that you're kind of bringing together and the time it might take for that to kind of sink into the sales cycle and pipelines?\n\n## Carl Eschenbach (Executives)\nYes. Thanks for the question, Brad. I'm going to turn it over to Gerrit to give some color and then I'll talk about it in the context of growth.\n\n## Gerrit Kazmaier (Executives)\nYes. So I think, first of all, for us, this is a continuation. As Carl has said, we have 1.4 billion AI actions already in production in the Workday platform today. So we have been doing this at Workday extremely successfully and now we are just taking the next steps in leading AI technology to help our customers become truly AI-driven enterprises. And specifically, the vectors of our innovation is with Paradox and in a bigger picture frontline, fully bringing AI automation to the entire hiring journey. \r\nIf you put that together with our recruiting agent, Paradox as a candidate engagement agent in connection with each other, it basically builds the AI-driven talent suite. What they're doing with Sana is we're acquiring leading knowledge management in a leading agent orchestrator to be the AI experience layer across Workday. So very important, when we think about AI adoption that our conviction is AI is going to be the new UI and that all of the legacy vendors who are not having leading experiences are going to get relocated through that. \r\nAnd thirdly, what you mentioned about Pipedream, right? Our ambition and our customers' requirements are actually taking us much broader than Workday is in finance and HR and really looking for enterprise-wide orchestration. We think about it as an enterprise AI fabric that we are creating through Pipedream with Sana as the experience layer on top, built on top of Workday's business process platform.\n\n## Carl Eschenbach (Executives)\nYes, Brad, the only color I'd add there is, clearly, we're going all in on AI, and it's for the following reason. We're uniquely positioned versus everyone else out there today. We have the data, right? We have the context of the data, and we're built in the business workflow. And our customers are saying, time and time again, they no longer want to even evaluate point AI solutions. They want to do it on the back of a trusted platform. Therefore, we go and we get something like Paradox, we get Pipedream, we get Sana, last year, Evisort. Before that, we get HiredScore. \r\nAnd it's not just our customers who are saying they believe in our platform, it's partners. To your point, we're partnering with Microsoft. So as they start to build agents, they see the most secure, reliable and trusted way to onboard their agents is through Workday in our Agent System of Record because no one has more experience in onboarding employees than Workday and now we're taking that to the digital worker as well.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nOur next question is from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\n\n## Brad Zelnick (Analysts)\nGreat. Brad following Brad. Congrats guys on a good quarter and thanks for taking the question. My question is about Workday GO, where we continue to hear really good things, particularly in ME and emerging enterprise. So it was interesting to see it soon to be more broadly available. Perhaps looking at AI from a different angle, is there anything different Workday needs to deliver from an AI product perspective for the downmarket customer versus large enterprise?\n\n## Carl Eschenbach (Executives)\nYes. Let me have Gerrit take that and then I'll talk more about Workday GO and the big announcement we had at Rising EMEA last week.\n\n## Gerrit Kazmaier (Executives)\nYes. And specifically, the AI side, Brad, there are 2 things to consider, right? One is that also medium-sized companies want to benefit from the best AI. So of course they're going to get the full power of Workday's AI agents also delivered in Workday GO. That's the first part, very important. And secondly, we are specifically innovating around Workday GO with specific AI models. Think about the whole configuration, administration, management of the system, setup complexity. We are working and announced a new deployment agent which already is slashing deployment time and complexity down by a significant degree. \r\nIt's a key investment theme for us and just connecting it back to the broader partner network, specifically with Workday GO to new managed services like payroll, we are working on payroll AI that is securely being connected into our ASO with our partners that are providing these services to also drive payroll automation, payroll simplification, benefits management across the Workday GO global partner network. And that's specifically being created all from that angle to make the mid-market customer run at the scale of Workday, but with unmatched simplicity.\n\n## Carl Eschenbach (Executives)\nYes. And Brad, we announced Workday GO, as I call it, 2.0 last week at EMEA Rising. And I will tell you, to Gerrit's point, the feedback was unbelievable with 3 key components to it. We now offer Global Payroll, if a customer wants it. By the way, if they don't want to use a managed Global Payroll service from Workday, they can bring their own payroll. We have a partner network that's going to help us take Workday GO to the market around the world and resell it on our behalf, and then we have that AI deployment agent. Also included in Workday GO is a payroll agent to help people simplify how they're managing their payroll activity across the enterprise. Workday GO, I will tell you, is on fire. People are excited about it, and people are leaning into Workday down market as we aggressively go attack that market segment around the world.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nOur next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\n\n## Aleksandr Zukin (Analysts)\nMaybe just a quick 2-parter. Carl, first for you, when you think about the commentary for next year, it's great to hear about the kind of reiterating the confidence and the growth rate of 13%. But since Analyst Day, is there anything that maybe you've seen that gives you even more confidence when you're talking with customers around things like budgets or their demand environments as we head into 2026 or propensity to maybe allocate more from the AI budget specifically to Workday that you could kind of comment on that gives you that confidence?\n\n## Carl Eschenbach (Executives)\nYes. Thanks, Alex, for the question. As Zane said in his prepared remarks, we feel really good about our midterm guide that we laid out for next year and we think the approximate 13% guide on subscription revenue next year is solid. That being said, we feel really good about all the acquired companies and the momentum we're seeing early on with them as well as the organic innovation that we have coming out of our super strong product and technology organization. \r\nWe haven't even talked about it, but we're also entering new markets like we've done the last couple years in the federal market here in the U.S. we're taking that to the public sector around the world. We announce entrance into the Middle East. And next week, we have a strong team led by Rob, our President of Customer Operations, going and launching our efforts in India. So we're really excited about all the growth vectors that we have going into next year as well as all the momentum we have around our AI solutions, both organic solutions and these inorganic solutions that we're getting through M&A.\n\n## Aleksandr Zukin (Analysts)\nPerfect. And then maybe just, Zane, as a follow-up, if we think about next year's guide that 13% and the acquisitions that you've made over the last couple of months, a, kind of how much do we think kind of comes from inorganic there? And then the pace of M&A, are we kind of through -- like should we think about this pace continuing at kind of current course and speed of these exciting technology tuck-ins? Is -- or do you need to digest the ones that you've made here over the course of the next few weeks, months, quarters?\n\n## Zane Rowe (Executives)\nSure, yes. Look, I'll start with -- as we think about the acquired revenue, I mean, first off, as you know and as you can see here, when we acquire companies, they quickly become part of the broader portfolio. So if you look at the acquired revenue, I'd say it probably contributes approximately 1 point into next year. But as you can tell, there's a lot more that we're doing around it and the whole portfolio benefits. So it's more -- there's significant synergy, if you want to think about it more broadly. \r\nBut on the acquired revenue, I'd call it sort of roughly 1 point heading into next year. And then we have a high bar on M&A. And as we've talked about all along, I mean we've kept consistent in thinking about the technology, the culture, the people and how they integrate either -- whether it's through adjacencies or tuck-ins or for different reasons. So I'd say no change in how we think about that and no change in how we incorporate that inorganic growth.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nOur next question is from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\n\n## Raimo Lenschow (Analysts)\nInternational is a big kind of driver for you and you mentioned a little bit of that, but like if I look at the growth rates, there's not that much difference between U.S. and international. Can you talk a little bit what you saw in the quarter? And maybe there was more on the pipeline build, et cetera.\n\n## Carl Eschenbach (Executives)\nYes. Thanks, Raimo. I hope you're well. So yes, we were really pleased with our international performance. And when I say international performance, it's across the 3 major regions that we describe as international. Europe, APAC and Japan. All 3 of those markets had a really good quarter for us. We've historically been talking about our performance in Europe when we talked about our international results. But this quarter, we're talking about it in the context of Europe, APAC and Japan because all 3 delivered solid results in the quarter. \r\nI think that's driven by 2 things. Number one, on the product side, we continue to internationalize and localize our product to serve all of these markets. Number two, we're leveraging a strong network of partners out there around the world to enter these markets. And the third is we continue to attract great talent to lead our Workday efforts around the world. The international market had great results, and we expect that momentum to continue as we see customers more and more lean into Workday for their platform of choice across HR and finance.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nOur last question is from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\n\n## Kasthuri Rangan (Analysts)\nLast question, and it's my last Workday earnings call as well, so fitting. So congrats on the Q3 results, Carl and Zane. I wonder -- it's clear that you guys are seeing a bit of -- quite a bit of AI momentum, right? And I agree with you, the AI disruption risk seems to be little overstated. But I think we can look at the numbers and say that AI, there's some tangible contribution. Your backlog, 12-month backlog growth rate, although it did include some acquisitions, it did do a little better. \r\nAnd these acquisitions, the anniversary, they are growing very nicely, that should lead to an acceleration in the organic growth rate as well. But that effect, conceptually, you put your thinking hats off or thinking hats on, sorry, down with the flu, a little too discombobulated. If you were to rebuild a company on an AI native stack -- an HCM company AI native stack today, what would that functionality be able to do? That is what would that stack be able to do that could be disruptive that you can do as a Workday customer with the tools that Workday is providing, be it organically or through these combinations of acquisitions?\n\n## Carl Eschenbach (Executives)\nKash, thanks for the question. And let me say thank you. Going all the way back to our founders, David and Neil, and all of our workmates over the last 20 years. We just want to thank you for your continued coverage of Workday. I know this is your last call with us and I just wanted to say thank you. And Neil said hello and he also wanted to send his regards as well, as do I and everyone else. You've been a great analyst for us, and we really appreciate your support over the years. And we all hope you enjoy your next phase of life, which you're telling us is retirement. I hope that's the case and you really do go out and spend some quality time with your amazing wife and family. With that, I'll hand it over to my friend, Gerrit, to talk about how he would build a new HCM or finance platform around AI going forward.\n\n## Gerrit Kazmaier (Executives)\nKash, thank you for ending on such a beautiful question. So let's just look at the core principles of building AI systems at scale, right? And let's just look at what it really is. The first thing that you need is a vast set of data which basically describes the domain, the domain of finance, the domain of HR. And you need a vast set of data that basically codifies how the data is being used, right? That is ingredient number one. If you look at AI at scale, it's about learning and using patterns. So you need to have that global database. \r\nSecondly, you need to have strong semantics and clarity about what data we present. So you need to have both a data model that defines what data element represents what entity in the business? What do they relate on? And what are the rules for these business entities because data is not created equal, right? They have integrity, they have meaning, they have purpose. And you need to have a business process system which now basically tells you how to activate this data in a way so it can drive towards a business outcome. Even more so you need to have clarity on what that business outcome is. Those are the basics of building a successful AI solution. \r\nNow take a look at Workday. We are the only scale SaaS vendor born in the cloud with a consolidated data set. Our 50 million to 75 million users that we have contribute to a uniform data model which is completely clean. We have all of the process data in a form of business process description codifying 70,000 core business process archetypes, which are instantiated across all of our customers and thousands of variations. We have ample data of usage and how these processes are being used in the business. \r\nAnd most importantly, the domain knowledge to specify what are the target outcomes to drive. So if you were to build a system that is built for enterprise AI at scale, it would look like Workday. And what we are doing right now, specifically is that we are opening up our core and basically integrate reasoning models and AI systems to automate these processes. We lay Asana on top to lead the experience, AI innovation on top of that. And if you look at all of that in aggregate, it truly is the AI stack for the enterprise of the future.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session.

      "text": "Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q3, we delivered solid results and completed a major milestone, closing our acquisition of Juniper Networks. Together with Juniper, we will accelerate our momentum across our 3 strategic business pillars: networking, cloud and AI, building a stronger, leaner and more profitable HPE. In Q3, HPE achieved record-breaking revenue with and without Juniper. Revenue was $9.1 billion, up 18% year-over-year, fueled by strong momentum across AI, networking and hybrid cloud.\r\nWe grew revenues year-over-year across our 3 largest business segments. Demand was broad-based across our products and services. We increased sequential operating profit dollars in Server, Hybrid Cloud and both Intelligent Edge and the new combined Networking segment. We also grew operating profit dollars in Financial Services on a year-over-year basis. The new combined Networking segment accounted for nearly 50% of HPE's non-GAAP consolidated operating profit. We also improved sequential operating profit margins in Server and Hybrid Cloud. Our improved profitability flowed through to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44.\r\nFree cash flow was $719 million as we significantly lowered our inventory driven by higher AI backlog conversion to revenue and strong supply chain execution. We continue to transform our business through Catalyst, the structural cost-saving program we announced last quarter, including enhancing operational efficiency, simplifying our portfolio, adopting AI and optimizing our workforce. In Q3, customers continue to demonstrate strong demand for our AI portfolio. We nearly doubled our AI order sequentially, driven by sovereign opportunities up approximately 250%.\r\nCumulative orders since Q1 2023 for sovereign and enterprise now account for more than 50% of total AI systems net orders. We exited the quarter with record AI backlog at $3.7 billion. Marie will provide more details on the quarter and our Q4 fiscal year 2025 guide. But first, I would like to provide key Q3 highlights across our business segments.\r\nI am incredibly pleased that we closed the Juniper acquisition in July. Integration is progressing well. I have been spending time with Rami and the new combined Networking leadership team, which is world-class. Going forward, we will refer to the combination of our HPE Intelligent Edge segment and Juniper as our new HPE Networking segment. Our vision for this segment is clear, to build the best networking business, providing customers with a modern, secure and AI-driven networking portfolio. Rami and I will discuss our networking strategy in more detail at our upcoming Securities Analyst Meeting in October. \r\nOn the demand front, the networking market recovery continues. In enterprise, we continue to see robust demand in campus and branch, driven by the wire and wireless refresh, SASE and data center switching. Wi-Fi 7 demand is ramping with orders up triple digits sequentially. In cloud, we see strong demand for networking for AI, particularly in data center switching and Juniper PTX routing. Revenue of $1.7 billion increased 54% year-over-year, driven by strong performances in both Intelligent Edge and Juniper. Intelligent Edge revenue increased 11% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter. We generated double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in campus and branch, data center switching, automated WAN and services. \r\nWe also grew SASE and security revenue. These strong results contributed to sustained momentum in Networking SaaS and support services. Operating profit for the Networking segment was $360 million, up 43% year-over-year, benefiting from 1 month of Juniper results and operating profit dollars expansion in Intelligent Edge. Networking innovation is accelerating across the entire Networking portfolio. Just last week, we introduced a new Mist agentic AI-native innovations for campus and branch, data center switching and automated WAN. These complement the new agentic AI mesh technology from our HPE Aruba Networking portfolio that we announced alongside GreenLake Intelligence at HPE Discover in June. \r\nOur innovation is being noticed by the market. HPE and Juniper Networks were both recognized again as leaders in the latest 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Wired and Wireless LAN Infrastructure. Customers are already taking advantage of the power of our full HPE portfolio with inclusion of HPE Juniper Networking solutions.  \r\nFor example, early this year, HPE won a multimillion-dollar deal with SPAR Austria Group, a leading retailer in Central Europe. SPAR is building out a digital business services platform underpinned by GreenLake. The full IT stack solution is designed and implemented by HPE professional services. It will be fully managed by HPE Managed Services and includes Aruba switches, Juniper firewalls, Alletra MP storage plus HPE Cloud Ops Software, including Zerto, OpsRamp and Morpheus. The solution will enable a cloud-native and AI-driven platform experience. Finally, with respect to integration synergies, we are reiterating at least $600 million in cost synergies over the next 3 years. \r\nIn the Server segment, market demand is robust across our portfolio. Revenue of $4.9 billion was an all-time high, increased 16% year-over-year and 21% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong conversion of AI orders and solid demand for traditional servers. AI systems revenue of $1.6 billion was also an all-time high as we completed the delivery of a large GB200 system.  \r\nServer operating margin improved sequentially, benefiting from the changes we made in pricing and discounting early in the year, which returned traditional server product margins to historical levels. This was partially offset by higher AI mix, including a large deal. As we enter Q4, we continue to expect total server operating margin to be around 10% for the quarter. AI systems orders increased nearly 100% quarter-over-quarter, including Middle East sovereign wins and continued traction in enterprise. We have grown enterprise AI orders year-over-year every quarter since the beginning of fiscal 2024.\r\nFrom an innovation perspective, we continue to keep pace with new accelerators technology and time-to-market customer demands. Last month, we launched HPE servers with the new NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell and NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra accelerated computing platforms. In traditional servers, customers are continuing to refresh aged infrastructure with more powerful, richly configured servers. As a result, revenue increased double digits year-over-year on mix shift to HPE Gen11 and Gen12 servers. During the quarter, we expanded the Gen12 compute portfolio to include the latest AMD fifth generation EPYC processors. The new servers include support for HPE Compute Ops Management with AI-driven life cycle management. We expect the Gen12 adoption to accelerate through 2026.\r\nIn Q3, we also released our next-generation HPE Nonstop Compute solutions for mission-critical workloads with double the memory capacity and double the system interconnect bandwidth.\r\nFinally, Hybrid Cloud performance was solid. Revenue of $1.5 billion increased year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter. In addition, operating profit margins were up 17 basis points and operating profit dollars increased 26% year-over-year. ARR increased 75% compared to Q3 2024 with the inclusion of 1 month of Juniper results. On an organic basis, ARR increased 40%, in line with our guidance of 35% to 45% CAGR.\r\nIn storage, we saw robust growth in our IP product portfolio. HPE Alletra MP storage revenue increased triple digits year-over-year. We have now shipped more than 5,000 Alletra MP arrays to date. We continue to successfully migrate our customer installed base while gaining new customer logos, resulting in a 1 point share gain in the most recently released IDC market share report.\r\nIn Private Cloud, we continue to ramp sales of our enterprise AI factory solutions. During Q3, we added twice the number of new private cloud AI customers compared to Q2 with particular interest in our developer configuration. Software is a core differentiator for our GreenLake Cloud and for our Private Cloud portfolio, which is a key contributor to our ARR growth. \r\nIn June, we announced our new HPE Hybrid Cloud Ops Suite Software, bringing together Morpheus, VM Essentials, OpsRamp and Zerto, to assist customers from hybrid cloud orchestration, virtualization and observability to continuous data protection. Our cloud software revenue in the quarter increased strong double digits year-over-year.\r\nAt Discover Las Vegas, we unveiled GreenLake Intelligence, our framework for deploying AI agents across cloud and infrastructure to simplify customers' hybrid IT operations. We also expanded our agentic AI capabilities in OpsRamp, networking and storage. Innovations like these continue to attract new customers to our GreenLake cloud. In Q3, we added approximately 2,000 new customers bringing our GreenLake cloud customer count to approximately 44,000.\r\nIn closing, as we look ahead, I am excited for HPE's next chapter. The completion of our Juniper acquisition position us to win in networking as the market enters a new era of IT and business transformation where AI, cloud and networking converge. We launched a new brand for HPE to reflect this potential. The brand is modern, expresses what our technology and talent make possible and reinforces our relevance with our customers.\r\nOur vision for the company is clear, to lead in the AI era through a modern secure cloud-native and AI-driven networking portfolio that accelerates our profitable growth. We are focused on executing with precision to capitalize on the growing opportunities in the market to deliver strong value to our customers and our shareholders. I look forward to providing more details about our strategy and our long-term value creation framework at our Securities Analyst Meeting on October 15 at the New York Stock Exchange.\r\nI would like now to turn it over to Marie to provide more insights into our quarterly results and full fiscal year guide. Marie?"

      "text": "Thank you, Antonio, and good afternoon. I'm pleased with our performance this quarter while navigating an evolving market environment. Regarding our results, first, all segments of our business performed well. Our Server business has moved past the pricing and discounting issues we reported earlier this year in compute. Hybrid Cloud posted its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year top line growth and operating margin expansion.  And revenue growth at our Intelligent Edge business is improving as the networking market recovery continues.\r\nSecond, I'm pleased that we completed our acquisition of Juniper, which will shift our revenue mix towards a higher-growth, higher-margin Networking business. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to our non-GAAP results in year 1, enhancing our profitability as we capture synergies and drive new market opportunities without increased scale.\r\nAnd finally, we made solid progress on our cost reduction initiatives announced last quarter. I'm looking forward to sharing more about the next chapter of our company at our Security Analyst Meeting next month.\r\nLet's talk about the details of the quarter. Third quarter revenue of $9.1 billion, which included Juniper was up 18% year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and up 11% excluding Juniper revenue of $480 million. Excluding Juniper, total revenue of $8.7 billion exceeded the high end of our outlook range. Demand was strong this quarter, and we did not see material demand pull-in.\r\nOur reported annualized recurring revenue run rate was $3.1 billion, including $519 million contributed by Juniper. Reported ARR was up 75% year-over-year or up 40%, excluding Juniper. Software and services ARR, including Juniper, doubled year-over-year as the mix of this higher margin revenue improved sequentially by 640 basis points to over 81%.\r\nIncluding Juniper, non-GAAP gross margin was 29.9%, down 190 basis points year-over-year and up 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin was impacted by an unfavorable mix within Server, Networking and Hybrid Cloud, which more than offset the beneficial margin contribution from 1 month of Juniper.\r\nExcluding Juniper, gross margin was 28.3%. Non-GAAP operating expense, including Juniper as a percentage of revenue was flat sequentially and declined 40 basis points year-over-year, reflecting strong revenue performance and disciplined cost management, partially offset by variable compensation. We will continue to manage costs rigorously as we target efficiencies through Catalyst, complemented by at least $600 million in expected Juniper-related cost synergies over the next 3 years with $200 million expected to be realized next year.\r\nExcluding Juniper, non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue was 20.2%, down 160 basis points year-over-year and down 120 basis points sequentially, driven by strong cost discipline as we grew revenue faster than expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin, including Juniper, was 8.5%, down 150 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to lower gross margins partially offset by cost management. The 50 basis point sequential improvement was primarily due to the inclusion of Juniper's results. Excluding Juniper, operating margin was 8.1%, down 190 basis points year-over-year but up 10 basis points sequentially. \r\nDuring the quarter, we generated free cash flow of $790 million including approximately $200 million of deal-related costs and higher net interest expense partially offset by improved inventory management. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44 was toward the high end of our guided range of $0.40 to $0.45. And non-GAAP diluted net EPS includes a $0.01 net impact attributable to consolidating 1 month of Juniper's results and the impact of net interest costs related to the acquisition.\r\nQ3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.21, below our guidance of $0.24 to $0.29. In terms of these results, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes $326 million in net costs primarily due to Juniper-related acquisition costs, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and acquisition, disposition and other charges, partially offset by adjustments for taxes, gain from litigation settlement and other adjustments.\r\nNow let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Networking. As previously mentioned, we closed our acquisition of Juniper on July 2, so our Q3 earnings report includes only 1 month of Juniper's results. Our Q4 Networking results will include our first full quarter of consolidated Juniper financials. We will provide more details regarding our near-term and longer-term strategy and outlook for our Networking business at our Security Analyst Meeting next month.\r\nNetworking revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, up 54% year-over-year, up 48% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year, excluding Juniper. Strong Networking revenue growth was driven by the ongoing recovery in the networking market and consolidation of Juniper's results for the month of July. While it's early days, we are pleased with our order growth and revenue performance we generated across the combined Networking business.\r\nReported orders grew strong double digits year-over-year, including double-digit growth in both campus switching and the SMB markets. Excluding Juniper, Intelligent Edge orders grew a mid-teens percent year-over-year. Demand in Q3 was strong as sell-out increased sequentially and year-over-year.\r\nNetworking operating margin was 20.8%, down 160 basis points year-over-year. This is inclusive of a 22.7% operating margin from HPE's former Intelligent Edge business and 15.8% operating margin from Juniper's networking business. Excluding Juniper, operating margin was down 90 basis points sequentially, primarily due to variable compensation and product-related costs.\r\nServer revenue was $4.9 billion, up 16% year-over-year and up 21% sequentially, above the high end of our guidance range. The quarter-over-quarter revenue increase was driven largely by a double-digit increase in AI systems revenue due to a large AI deal we shipped in the quarter, augmented by higher AUP from a favorable mix shift in core compute.\r\nIn traditional server, revenue increased sequentially, driven by volume increases and AUP strength supported by the continued shift to Gen11 servers, augmented by early yet improving sales of our Gen12 servers. In AI systems, we signed $2.1 billion in net new orders driven by robust growth in sovereign net new orders, which increased by triple digits both year-over-year and sequentially, while enterprise net new orders were also up year-over-year. Together, enterprise and sovereign constitute greater than 50% of our cumulative AI orders since Q1 '23. \r\nWe generated $1.6 billion of revenue during the quarter, up 25% year-over-year and up 57% sequentially, driven by the previously disclosed large AI system that we shipped in the quarter. We finished Q3 with our pipeline at multiples of our $3.7 billion ending backlog. Server operating margin of 6.4% was consistent with our outlook. Margin performance improved sequentially, benefiting from the changes we made in pricing and discounting earlier in the year, which returned traditional server product margins to historical levels. This was partially offset by higher AI mix, including a large deal and AI inventory.\r\nMoving to Hybrid Cloud. Revenue was $1.5 billion, up 11% year-over-year, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Sequentially, revenue increased 1%, consistent with our outlook. In storage, our HPE Alletra MP platform continues to drive robust growth, achieving triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter, while high double-digit margins expanded sequentially again.\r\nIn Q3, new logos were up more than 350 sequentially and grew over 70% year-over-year. In Private Cloud, revenue grew strong double digits year-over-year as we see continued growth in our pipeline for PC AI with a number of new enterprise customers doubled quarter-over-quarter. Also, our VM Essential solutions closed over 120 customers in Q3 and has generated a pipeline exceeding 1,000 interested customers since its launch last November. Hybrid Cloud operating margin increased 50 basis points sequentially to 5.9% and increased 70 basis points year-over-year, the fourth consecutive quarter that our OP margin has expanded on a year-over-year basis.\r\nLastly, our Financial Services business generated revenue of $886 million, down 1% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter.  Financing volumes increased 2% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. Our Q3 loss ratio was 0.7%, and return on equity improved sequentially and year-over-year to 17.7%. Operating margin of 9.9% increased 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a higher mix of financing versus operating leases but declined 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter, driven by unfavorable operating expenses despite the higher revenue.\r\nLast quarter, we announced Catalyst a series of initiatives designed to accelerate growth, increase efficiency and make it easier to do business with HPE. Our starting point was an approximate 5% workforce reduction from the exit of Q1 with gross savings of at least $350 million by fiscal year 2027. We are executing well against our plan and expect to achieve our target of 20% of the total savings by fiscal year-end 2025. We are taking an AI-first approach to reimagine our key workflows and have started in my own finance organization leveraging AI to increase productivity.\r\nTurning to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, and free cash flow was a positive $790 million, a significant improvement sequentially as expected. At the end of fiscal Q3, inventory totaled $7.2 billion, down $933 million sequentially. Excluding July ending Juniper inventory of approximately $1 billion, Q3 ending stand-alone HPE inventory was $6.2 billion, down $1.9 billion sequentially. Reducing inventory levels has been a key priority, and we exited Q3 with our balance near our normalized level.\r\nOur Q3 cash conversion cycle was positive 35 days, up 9 days from last quarter. The inclusion of Juniper unfavorably impacted our CCC calculation this quarter as it includes only 1 month of Juniper's revenue and cost of sales results versus the consolidation of Juniper's July ending balances. This timing issue obscures both the progress we made improving our CCC and the positive contributions for working capital the business generated on a sequential basis when excluding Juniper. We expect our CCC will improve in Q4 with a full quarter's consolidation of Juniper's financials as we expect the amount of free cash flow we generate to increase sequentially, consistent with typical seasonality.\r\nWe returned $171 million to shareholders through dividends but were unable to repurchase shares during the quarter because we were in possession of material nonpublic information that we have since disclosed. As we prioritize debt reduction, we remain committed to our dividend policy and expect quarterly share repurchases comparable to levels reported in the first half of fiscal '25, partially offsetting share dilution resulting from stock-based compensation.\r\nAt quarter end and including incremental debt associated with the transaction, our pro forma combined net leverage ratio was 3.1x. We remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating and intend to reduce our net leverage ratio back to our target in the 2x range by the end of fiscal 2027.\r\nNow let's turn to guidance. We are revising our FY '25 outlook to incorporate 4 months of contributions from Juniper Networks. For revenue, we expect constant currency growth of 14% to 16% and estimate currency impacts of 30 basis points, up nominally versus last quarter's estimate. With the inclusion of Juniper, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin outlook for Q4 to be in the mid-30% range and fiscal 2025 to be above 30%. We expect operating expense to increase sequentially, driven by a full quarter inclusion of Juniper. We expect full year non-GAAP operating margin to be in the upper 9% range at the midpoint, benefiting from a sequential improvement in Q4 to the upper 11% range, driven by the continued improvement in Server margins and the accretive contributions from Juniper. \r\nWe are revising our FY '25 GAAP EPS range to $0.42 to $0.46, which includes the impact of Juniper. We are raising our non-GAAP EPS range to $1.88 to $1.92, which reflects accretive contributions from Juniper, though minimal for the year. We are reaffirming our estimate of a $0.02 impact from tariffs in the second half of the year. \r\nLastly, we are revising our free cash flow outlook to approximately $700 million. Excluding Juniper, we expect to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow in line with the guidance we provided last quarter. Through the end of Q3, year-to-date free cash flow was a $934 million use of cash. We expect Q4 free cash flow to be up materially quarter-over-quarter due to better net earnings in addition to favorable working capital driven by significant improvements in accounts receivable collections.\r\nFor Q4, we expect revenue to be between $9.7 billion and $10.1 billion. For Networking, we expect revenue will be up over 60% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting a full quarter of Juniper. We expect our Networking operating margin in Q4 and fiscal 2025 to be in the low 20% range. For Hybrid Cloud, we expect revenue to be roughly flat quarter-over-quarter with a sequentially improved operating margin in the mid- to high single digits. For Server, we forecast a mid- to high single-digit decline in revenue quarter-over-quarter, driven by a greater than 30% sequential decline in AI systems revenue following the large deal that shipped in Q3. We expect Server operating margin to improve sequentially to around 10% for the quarter, reflecting continued momentum behind our improved execution and an improved mix towards enterprise and sovereign as we continue to focus on profitable growth. Going forward, we will remain focused on profitable growth in the Server segment, and we'll continue to assess the optimal balance between volume growth and margins.\r\nWe expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be between $0.50 and $0.54 and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be between $0.56 and $0.60. Our Q4 EPS outlook reflects a sequential increase in diluted shares outstanding to 1.44 billion attributable to the conversion of Juniper-related stock-based compensation shares and forward awards. \r\nFollowing the acquisition of Juniper, we now expect Q4 OI&E in the $180 million to $200 million range. We expect Q4 free cash flow to be up sequentially, reflecting typical seasonality, favorable working capital and increased net earnings.\r\nWith that, I look forward to seeing you at SAM in October. And now let me open the floor for questions."

I think, Antonio, in your prepared comments, you said that we've returned to more of a normalized operating margin on the traditional server line. I guess if I look back, I would assume that's kind of in that low double digit, let's call it, 11% to 13% range. I guess if I'm to do that math, it leaves me to question the profitability of the AI server business. And so I guess as you think about that 10%, maybe you can unpack the drivers of getting to that level. And how should we think about that AI server margin profile?"

      "text": "Thank you, Aaron, for the question. First, we are very pleased with the progression we made between Q1 to Q2 to Q3 based on the challenges we experienced in Q1 with price and discounting. And as you said, we resolved those issues and the traditional server is back to historical levels around that 10% to 12%, as you talked about it. And so we believe that's consistent with what we see going forward. \r\nRemember, there is a mix shift in addition to those pricing and discount changes to Gen11 and Gen12. The structure of those products is different than Gen10 or Gen10.5, obviously has higher AUP, different attach rates and the like. And that's going to be a core foundation as we enter Q4 for delivering at the total server segment the -- around 10% for the quarter.\r\nNow this quarter, obviously, the mix of AI and in particular, one deal and the work we did on inventory had a short-term impact that ultimately took that, what I call the overall server margin, down to the 6.4%. But as we exit that, which already recognized, then you're going to get a natural lift into that higher single digit to close to 10%. And then, therefore also, you have also the mix of sovereign and enterprise in the AI revenue conversion because as we move from more a server-provider-centric revenue conversion to more a sovereign and enterprise revenue conversion in AI, obviously, we're going to convert less in aggregate numbers, but it's going to have a different margin profile. And that's why Marie and I and the team are very confident that, in Q4, the total server operating margin will be around 10%. So that's the walk, Aaron."

I think it was closed at to the right time because, obviously, market recovery is taking place, but also, we see demand across multiple subsegments of the networking market. And as we commented during my remarks and Marie's remark, every subsegment networking had a very strong performance, whether it was HPE Intelligent Edge standalone or Juniper standalone and obviously, on a combined basis is even very, very strong.\r\nBut if you look at campus and branch, both companies are doing very well. Both companies grow in double digits, so that's very strong. In data center switching, and we talked about this during the July 9 call, Juniper had a record break in performance in data center switches and also a very good performance in routing, which we call it the automated WAN. Security was also up in the single-digit year-over-year revenue growth driven by SASE. And then the progress we have made is that -- is very strong, meaning integration is progressing really well. \r\nWe have a series of milestones, which we call it the employee day 1, which is onboarding the employees into our systems. That's a combination of benefits and other things that have to take place. And then we have the harmonization of the sales force, which we call it sales day 1, and that takes place at the end of this calendar year. And we already are incentivizing both sales forces to sell both products. And I can tell you the channel community is super excited to be able to sell both products because the combination of both products allows them to cover every vertical, every use case in every geography. And the fact of the matter is that the complementary 2 portfolio allows us to drive strong security integration in our stack in addition to the integration with the rest of the portfolio with server and storage.\r\nSo we will be able to talk more about this, Wamsi, at the Securities Analyst Meeting. Rami will take center stage and walk through the strategy, early views of the product road map, how we are driving the sales force integration including our channel ecosystem. And we believe that's going to be an opportunity as we enter 2026 and then obviously, '27, '28.\r\nYour question about AI. As I think about the AI space, I always ground myself on 3 very distinct customer segments. In the service provider segment and model builders, our strategy is to lead with networking for AI. The opportunity is significant. Juniper is getting traction, is becoming the de facto standard in many of those customers, and the opportunity with HPE is to expand that footprint. And then we will sell the server products in that unique segment where it makes sense from an accretion from a margin perspective and working capital perspective.\r\nIf you go to the sovereign space, which we saw this quarter a 200-plus percent growth on a year-over-year basis and that sovereign also includes neoclouds, we will lead with an integrated rack scale architecture, meaning Networking plus the Server business and all the services that comes with it. And that will allow us to cover multiple type of offerings as customers in that segment may have the need to drive optionality and flexibility, and we have unique conversations with our partners.\r\nAnd then in the enterprise space, through the AI factory engagement with our private cloud AI portfolio, which this quarter added 300-plus new logos, double from last quarter, we will lead with a fully integrated stack. And that's what we did with NVIDIA. The integration of their software with our GreenLake plus the integrated infrastructure with our HPE ProLiant and Cray for the GPUs and then our Alletra MP storage or fast object and file plus all the services around it to life cycle manage that solution.\r\nSo I think at a portfolio level, we can service every segment, find the right balance, but I think [ networking us ] make us now stronger in the AI space because one of the key elements of that IT stack is the network at scale. Juniper brings amazing technology both at the data center switching and the routing piece because once you integrate this in a large AI deployment, you need to core aggregate all of this through the leaf and spine into the data center footprint, and that requires also a routing product. So more to come at SAM."

Your Networking overall margins are taking a bit of a step down to the sort of low 20% range, where the segment historically has been about mid-20s. How should we think about with the synergy road map that you have when the segment gets back to that sort of mid-20s level? Because some of the back-of-the-envelope math on the synergies would suggest you could actually probably go north of that as well long term. But maybe just lay out the road map for us in terms of how to think about the progress on the margin front from the new sort of level that you have post consolidation of Juniper.\r\nAnd Marie, if I can quickly squeeze in one on cash, get the headwinds in terms of closing Juniper on the cash flow this year. But how should we think about sort of the impact on next year's cash flow in relation to any closing costs or integration costs?"

      "text": "Yes, no worries. And thanks, Antonio. So just to preface my answer before I get started, so I'm going to answer both questions in the context of our Q4 and full year '25 guide. We will provide longer-term update to your questions, particularly around cash as we get into Security Analyst Meeting in early October. So let me unpack first of all the networking margin rate. So in the quarter, as you recall, we integrated a month of Juniper's results and our Intelligent Edge business. We combine them now into 1 segment called the Networking segment, and the combined operating margins were 20.8%. \r\nIf you look -- I think your question was focused specifically on the edge business. Our edge margin, actually, I disclosed in my prepared remarks, was 22.7%. And we did see a sequential reduction, and that was really due to 2 primary factors. One is variable comp expense, and the other one is product-related costs. And I did guide the Q4 op range to the low 20s as we get into the quarter. And the reason for that, Samik, is obviously, Juniper's rate was a few points below our Intelligent Edge business. So just bear that in mind as you think forward to the Networking margin rates.\r\nNow with respect to your question on cash flow, we're confident in our guidance for the year. And I would just say, as you think about cash, the puts and takes, obviously, you brought up Juniper costs, and we will give more clarity on that as we get through to SAM. But even as we get into Q4, there's obviously costs that I believe I commented on in Q3 and Q4 and also the increase in OI&E., so all of that taken into account when you think about cash flow.\r\nAnd I'd just add, look, we are absolutely focused on free cash flow. We'll give you a lot more detail as we head to Security Analyst. As you know, our leverage has gone up, and so free cash flow generation is paramount for us."

I guess, simplistically, how do you think about the growth rate for the combined business as we go forward? If you think the networking market grows 5%, 6% a year, how do you think HPE plus Juniper can do? And then really, over time, how do you think about product integration on the campus side between Aruba and Mist? Do you think we need to Mistify Aruba or -- and have a single product? Or do you think you can have both the products in the marketplace simultaneously?"

      "text": "Yes. Thanks, Amit. Rami and I and the team are very pleased with the momentum both businesses have in the market. That's a reflection that both offers are very strong. And let's remind ourselves that that's true for campus and branch. But when you go to data center switching and obviously, the WAN business, that's 100% Juniper. And then in the security space, we have a robust security portfolio because we need to lead with a secure network approach, and that's inclusive of Juniper firewalls and the secure access service edge or SSE, which both companies have very strong offerings. And as you recall, in 2020, we acquired Silver Peak to drive the convergence between SD-WAN and security.\r\nBut as I think going forward, our goal is to build the best networking business, and that means we're going to grow above market. And that's the reality, and we're going to explain how that's going to be the case over the next 3 years. And we have an opportunity across AI and cloud and across the infrastructure itself. And when I think about the campus and branch question, we were very clear with Rami. We're going to thoughtfully integrate the Juniper platform and the Aruba central platform because you need to think about DAL layer. Everything below that is very straightforward.\r\nThere is no confusion because the reality is that we have a very strong robust campus switching portfolio, which obviously has -- a lot of that has the wired piece, which is Aruba silicon than Wi-Fi access points. I don't think that's too complicated, and we're going to show what that looks like. And then finally, is the extension into IoT private 5G, which obviously HPE has unique offers. But that integration of the cloud and AIOps is where that experience will evolve.\r\nBut we are not going to leave any customers behind. We're going to sell both products, and you're going to see an integration that suddenly happen over time through the AIOps layer. And that's the opportunity we have here. And the good news, customers want both today, and we can serve every market vertical. And we can also deploy any type of solution, whether it's cloud-based, virtual private cloud, meaning sovereign and then on-prem. And that's the opportunity we have ahead of us.\r\nAnd then last but not least, on the data center switching side, in addition to networking for AI, we are also working integration in the private cloud portfolio with the software-defined networking components that Juniper brings through Fidelma's hybrid CloudOps suite. And then obviously, in our storage and Server business, which required a switch along the way."

I think you talked about the traction that Juniper is getting with some of these AI model builders and sort of that part of the network. How much of sort of the opportunity to grow is predicated on Juniper's traction with those customers? And then maybe along those lines, I think Marie mentioned some product-related costs. Was that mix in the networking section do more AI-centric offerings? And how do we think about that mix shift going forward from a more enterprise campus-centric model to one more -- hopefully, one more towards an AI model building sort of cloud model going forward?"

      "text": "Yes. Thank you. No, the AI opportunity is across all the 3 segments I mentioned earlier, right, in Networking, which is the service provider where we have the vision to lead with networking there because there is unique value proposition, performance, cost, simplicity, life cycle management and AI-driven capabilities. When you go to the sovereign space, same thesis. And that's even more important because you now drive rack scale integration with the rest of the Server business. And then at the enterprise layer, of course, we want to integrate the Juniper switch in everything we do in cloud and AI going forward by giving customers choice and flexibility. So the opportunity for networking in AI is across all 3 segments. \r\nNow in the service provider space, obviously, once you lay down the simple analogy you make, you lay the pipes inside the data center and you connect the data center to the rest of the interconnect process, then obviously, you become the standard. And then from that solution, you kind of hang this amount of GPUs that comes with those deployments. And so this is why the opportunity is significant, and the benefit for Juniper, which already had good traction, is access to a very -- a larger number of customers that we're not able to access before because we are strategic in many geos.\r\nRemember, we cover 172 countries and also our heritage in countries and geographies where our mix is shifted to those geos, example, Europe and Asia versus North America. So there is an opportunity here as we integrate the sales force but also integrate the architectures."

And really, what I'm trying to understand is there are some maybe concerns that the markets could be rolling over. There's obviously a lot of aged infrastructure that can be refreshed. What are you hearing from your customers about prioritizing those types of upgrades? And from the HPE perspective, if we put networking to the side because you've talked ad nauseam there, just where do you see the biggest opportunity to take share with the core HPE portfolio in those respective end markets?"

      "text": "Well, thank you, Erik and welcome. I know you are starting the coverage of our company just a few weeks ago, so we appreciate you spending time with us. My view is that the market is robust. We saw that throughout the Q3 quarter. Linearity was very consistent. There was nothing unnatural despite sometimes the Trump tariffs, tariffs, but Marie commented on that, that the net impact of that is very minimal for us at this point in time.\r\nAnd I will say, on the server side, let's start with that, on the traditional server side. There is a refresh going on. We saw double digits year-over-year revenue growth in traditional servers. Customers are refreshing aged infrastructure with more richly configured servers because they can reduce space and cooling on an aggregate basis. So with our introduction on Gen12 servers, we demonstrated we can replace 7 Gen11 servers and 14 Gen10 servers by -- and at the same time, reducing the power consumption by 65% in addition to increase the security in their infrastructure because now we support our own internal iLO 7, which is basically the quantum-proof encryption. \r\nAnd so that's an example of what we see, and that was consistent across all 3 geos. Now there, we participate with discipline, and ultimately, it's a question of volume and margins, which we demonstrated in Q3 that we can do after the challenge we had in Q1. So that's one example. And we believe -- over time, we believe we are poised to potentially gain share in enterprise.\r\nIn the hybrid cloud space, huge opportunity through the transition of the virtualization layer, one of the areas people are focused on AI, obviously, for good reasons. But I can tell you, one of the most exciting areas we see is the ability for customers to update or change their virtualization layer because of the rising costs they have seen in the last, call it, 2 years. We have an enormous amount of proof of concepts going on with our Morpheus and VM Essentials.\r\nWhere we really focus there is the conversion from POCs to revenue. This quarter, we had double-digit growth in our entire software portfolio, which includes OpsRamp, which provides deep observability inside the data center and outside the data center and a multicloud and multivendor so that they can use our AI copilot capabilities that we built inside GreenLake to reduce OpEx.  So they can reduce OpEx on licenses and can reduce OpEx on running that infrastructure in a way it is observed. So that's another example of growth that we expect.\r\nPrivate Cloud is another area we expect to grow. And then Storage on our transition to our IP portfolio, this was the third consecutive quarter of triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth in Alletra MP. Why that's happening is because we architected a new platform. That's totally disaggregated. That provides the most effective block solution for those structural databases while, at the same time, leverage the same infrastructure and grow that in a scale out architecture into the unstructured data for fast object, which is necessary for training or fine-tuning rack models, especially if you do that on-prem and then eventually to do file ingestion. That value proposition is resonating with customers. That's why we gained 1 point of share in the last report from IDC.\r\nAnd then in networking, you're right, we spoke ad nauseam but I do believe there is a transition anyway in the wired switching. Remember, we grew triple digits in Wi-Fi 7. And when you go to Wi-Fi 7, also you need more power at the port level to support those access points. And I believe that's going to be also another opportunity for us."

And that's why we believe there is a big opportunity in leading with networking for AI in that particular couple of segments. And so that's our strategy going forward. And then obviously, that will make our servers more attractive because also we will have more integration of the rack scale for the sovereign space.\r\nAnd Juniper, when the transaction closed, had a very nice backlog that they built prior to the acquisition, and we expect to unwind that backlog and new orders as we go forward. And so Rami will be able to explain more about this as we go to the Security Analyst Meeting from a pure architecture perspective and how we are approaching that from a sales perspective. So thank you. \r\nYes. Sorry, we're running out of time, but we appreciate your time today. I hope you take away that we are executing with precision, that we have a clear vision for the company. I am and the management team is very excited about the next chapter of HPE after the closing of the Juniper transaction.

Good afternoon, everyone. In Q3, we delivered solid results and completed a major milestone, closing our acquisition of Juniper Networks. Together with Juniper, we will accelerate our momentum across our 3 strategic business pillars: networking, cloud and AI, building a stronger, leaner and more profitable HPE. In Q3, HPE achieved record-breaking revenue with and without Juniper. Revenue was $9.1 billion, up 18% year-over-year, fueled by strong momentum across AI, networking and hybrid cloud.\r\nWe grew revenues year-over-year across our 3 largest business segments. Demand was broad-based across our products and services. We increased sequential operating profit dollars in Server, Hybrid Cloud and both Intelligent Edge and the new combined Networking segment. We also grew operating profit dollars in Financial Services on a year-over-year basis. The new combined Networking segment accounted for nearly 50% of HPE's non-GAAP consolidated operating profit. We also improved sequential operating profit margins in Server and Hybrid Cloud. Our improved profitability flowed through to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44.\r\nFree cash flow was $719 million as we significantly lowered our inventory driven by higher AI backlog conversion to revenue and strong supply chain execution. We continue to transform our business through Catalyst, the structural cost-saving program we announced last quarter, including enhancing operational efficiency, simplifying our portfolio, adopting AI and optimizing our workforce. In Q3, customers continue to demonstrate strong demand for our AI portfolio. We nearly doubled our AI order sequentially, driven by sovereign opportunities up approximately 250%.\r\nCumulative orders since Q1 2023 for sovereign and enterprise now account for more than 50% of total AI systems net orders. We exited the quarter with record AI backlog at $3.7 billion. Marie will provide more details on the quarter and our Q4 fiscal year 2025 guide. But first, I would like to provide key Q3 highlights across our business segments.\r\nI am incredibly pleased that we closed the Juniper acquisition in July. Integration is progressing well. I have been spending time with Rami and the new combined Networking leadership team, which is world-class. Going forward, we will refer to the combination of our HPE Intelligent Edge segment and Juniper as our new HPE Networking segment. Our vision for this segment is clear, to build the best networking business, providing customers with a modern, secure and AI-driven networking portfolio. Rami and I will discuss our networking strategy in more detail at our upcoming Securities Analyst Meeting in October. \r\nOn the demand front, the networking market recovery continues. In enterprise, we continue to see robust demand in campus and branch, driven by the wire and wireless refresh, SASE and data center switching. Wi-Fi 7 demand is ramping with orders up triple digits sequentially. In cloud, we see strong demand for networking for AI, particularly in data center switching and Juniper PTX routing. Revenue of $1.7 billion increased 54% year-over-year, driven by strong performances in both Intelligent Edge and Juniper. Intelligent Edge revenue increased 11% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter. We generated double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in campus and branch, data center switching, automated WAN and services. \r\nWe also grew SASE and security revenue. These strong results contributed to sustained momentum in Networking SaaS and support services. Operating profit for the Networking segment was $360 million, up 43% year-over-year, benefiting from 1 month of Juniper results and operating profit dollars expansion in Intelligent Edge. Networking innovation is accelerating across the entire Networking portfolio. Just last week, we introduced a new Mist agentic AI-native innovations for campus and branch, data center switching and automated WAN. These complement the new agentic AI mesh technology from our HPE Aruba Networking portfolio that we announced alongside GreenLake Intelligence at HPE Discover in June. \r\nOur innovation is being noticed by the market. HPE and Juniper Networks were both recognized again as leaders in the latest 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Wired and Wireless LAN Infrastructure. Customers are already taking advantage of the power of our full HPE portfolio with inclusion of HPE Juniper Networking solutions.  \r\nFor example, early this year, HPE won a multimillion-dollar deal with SPAR Austria Group, a leading retailer in Central Europe. SPAR is building out a digital business services platform underpinned by GreenLake. The full IT stack solution is designed and implemented by HPE professional services. It will be fully managed by HPE Managed Services and includes Aruba switches, Juniper firewalls, Alletra MP storage plus HPE Cloud Ops Software, including Zerto, OpsRamp and Morpheus. The solution will enable a cloud-native and AI-driven platform experience. Finally, with respect to integration synergies, we are reiterating at least $600 million in cost synergies over the next 3 years. \r\nIn the Server segment, market demand is robust across our portfolio. Revenue of $4.9 billion was an all-time high, increased 16% year-over-year and 21% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong conversion of AI orders and solid demand for traditional servers. AI systems revenue of $1.6 billion was also an all-time high as we completed the delivery of a large GB200 system.  \r\nServer operating margin improved sequentially, benefiting from the changes we made in pricing and discounting early in the year, which returned traditional server product margins to historical levels. This was partially offset by higher AI mix, including a large deal. As we enter Q4, we continue to expect total server operating margin to be around 10% for the quarter. AI systems orders increased nearly 100% quarter-over-quarter, including Middle East sovereign wins and continued traction in enterprise. We have grown enterprise AI orders year-over-year every quarter since the beginning of fiscal 2024.\r\nFrom an innovation perspective, we continue to keep pace with new accelerators technology and time-to-market customer demands. Last month, we launched HPE servers with the new NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell and NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra accelerated computing platforms. In traditional servers, customers are continuing to refresh aged infrastructure with more powerful, richly configured servers. As a result, revenue increased double digits year-over-year on mix shift to HPE Gen11 and Gen12 servers. During the quarter, we expanded the Gen12 compute portfolio to include the latest AMD fifth generation EPYC processors. The new servers include support for HPE Compute Ops Management with AI-driven life cycle management. We expect the Gen12 adoption to accelerate through 2026.\r\nIn Q3, we also released our next-generation HPE Nonstop Compute solutions for mission-critical workloads with double the memory capacity and double the system interconnect bandwidth.\r\nFinally, Hybrid Cloud performance was solid. Revenue of $1.5 billion increased year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter. In addition, operating profit margins were up 17 basis points and operating profit dollars increased 26% year-over-year. ARR increased 75% compared to Q3 2024 with the inclusion of 1 month of Juniper results. On an organic basis, ARR increased 40%, in line with our guidance of 35% to 45% CAGR.\r\nIn storage, we saw robust growth in our IP product portfolio. HPE Alletra MP storage revenue increased triple digits year-over-year. We have now shipped more than 5,000 Alletra MP arrays to date. We continue to successfully migrate our customer installed base while gaining new customer logos, resulting in a 1 point share gain in the most recently released IDC market share report.\r\nIn Private Cloud, we continue to ramp sales of our enterprise AI factory solutions. During Q3, we added twice the number of new private cloud AI customers compared to Q2 with particular interest in our developer configuration. Software is a core differentiator for our GreenLake Cloud and for our Private Cloud portfolio, which is a key contributor to our ARR growth. \r\nIn June, we announced our new HPE Hybrid Cloud Ops Suite Software, bringing together Morpheus, VM Essentials, OpsRamp and Zerto, to assist customers from hybrid cloud orchestration, virtualization and observability to continuous data protection. Our cloud software revenue in the quarter increased strong double digits year-over-year.\r\nAt Discover Las Vegas, we unveiled GreenLake Intelligence, our framework for deploying AI agents across cloud and infrastructure to simplify customers' hybrid IT operations. We also expanded our agentic AI capabilities in OpsRamp, networking and storage. Innovations like these continue to attract new customers to our GreenLake cloud. In Q3, we added approximately 2,000 new customers bringing our GreenLake cloud customer count to approximately 44,000.\r\nIn closing, as we look ahead, I am excited for HPE's next chapter. The completion of our Juniper acquisition position us to win in networking as the market enters a new era of IT and business transformation where AI, cloud and networking converge. We launched a new brand for HPE to reflect this potential. The brand is modern, expresses what our technology and talent make possible and reinforces our relevance with our customers.\r\nOur vision for the company is clear, to lead in the AI era through a modern secure cloud-native and AI-driven networking portfolio that accelerates our profitable growth. We are focused on executing with precision to capitalize on the growing opportunities in the market to deliver strong value to our customers and our shareholders. I look forward to providing more details about our strategy and our long-term value creation framework at our Securities Analyst Meeting on October 15 at the New York Stock Exchange.\r\nI would like now to turn it over to Marie to provide more insights into our quarterly results and full fiscal year guide. Marie?\n\n## Marie Myers (Executives)\nThank you, Antonio, and good afternoon. I'm pleased with our performance this quarter while navigating an evolving market environment. Regarding our results, first, all segments of our business performed well. Our Server business has moved past the pricing and discounting issues we reported earlier this year in compute. Hybrid Cloud posted its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year top line growth and operating margin expansion.  And revenue growth at our Intelligent Edge business is improving as the networking market recovery continues.\r\nSecond, I'm pleased that we completed our acquisition of Juniper, which will shift our revenue mix towards a higher-growth, higher-margin Networking business. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to our non-GAAP results in year 1, enhancing our profitability as we capture synergies and drive new market opportunities without increased scale.\r\nAnd finally, we made solid progress on our cost reduction initiatives announced last quarter. I'm looking forward to sharing more about the next chapter of our company at our Security Analyst Meeting next month.\r\nLet's talk about the details of the quarter. Third quarter revenue of $9.1 billion, which included Juniper was up 18% year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and up 11% excluding Juniper revenue of $480 million. Excluding Juniper, total revenue of $8.7 billion exceeded the high end of our outlook range. Demand was strong this quarter, and we did not see material demand pull-in.\r\nOur reported annualized recurring revenue run rate was $3.1 billion, including $519 million contributed by Juniper. Reported ARR was up 75% year-over-year or up 40%, excluding Juniper. Software and services ARR, including Juniper, doubled year-over-year as the mix of this higher margin revenue improved sequentially by 640 basis points to over 81%.\r\nIncluding Juniper, non-GAAP gross margin was 29.9%, down 190 basis points year-over-year and up 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin was impacted by an unfavorable mix within Server, Networking and Hybrid Cloud, which more than offset the beneficial margin contribution from 1 month of Juniper.\r\nExcluding Juniper, gross margin was 28.3%. Non-GAAP operating expense, including Juniper as a percentage of revenue was flat sequentially and declined 40 basis points year-over-year, reflecting strong revenue performance and disciplined cost management, partially offset by variable compensation. We will continue to manage costs rigorously as we target efficiencies through Catalyst, complemented by at least $600 million in expected Juniper-related cost synergies over the next 3 years with $200 million expected to be realized next year.\r\nExcluding Juniper, non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue was 20.2%, down 160 basis points year-over-year and down 120 basis points sequentially, driven by strong cost discipline as we grew revenue faster than expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin, including Juniper, was 8.5%, down 150 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to lower gross margins partially offset by cost management. The 50 basis point sequential improvement was primarily due to the inclusion of Juniper's results. Excluding Juniper, operating margin was 8.1%, down 190 basis points year-over-year but up 10 basis points sequentially. \r\nDuring the quarter, we generated free cash flow of $790 million including approximately $200 million of deal-related costs and higher net interest expense partially offset by improved inventory management. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44 was toward the high end of our guided range of $0.40 to $0.45. And non-GAAP diluted net EPS includes a $0.01 net impact attributable to consolidating 1 month of Juniper's results and the impact of net interest costs related to the acquisition.\r\nQ3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.21, below our guidance of $0.24 to $0.29. In terms of these results, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes $326 million in net costs primarily due to Juniper-related acquisition costs, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and acquisition, disposition and other charges, partially offset by adjustments for taxes, gain from litigation settlement and other adjustments.\r\nNow let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Networking. As previously mentioned, we closed our acquisition of Juniper on July 2, so our Q3 earnings report includes only 1 month of Juniper's results. Our Q4 Networking results will include our first full quarter of consolidated Juniper financials. We will provide more details regarding our near-term and longer-term strategy and outlook for our Networking business at our Security Analyst Meeting next month.\r\nNetworking revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, up 54% year-over-year, up 48% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year, excluding Juniper. Strong Networking revenue growth was driven by the ongoing recovery in the networking market and consolidation of Juniper's results for the month of July. While it's early days, we are pleased with our order growth and revenue performance we generated across the combined Networking business.\r\nReported orders grew strong double digits year-over-year, including double-digit growth in both campus switching and the SMB markets. Excluding Juniper, Intelligent Edge orders grew a mid-teens percent year-over-year. Demand in Q3 was strong as sell-out increased sequentially and year-over-year.\r\nNetworking operating margin was 20.8%, down 160 basis points year-over-year. This is inclusive of a 22.7% operating margin from HPE's former Intelligent Edge business and 15.8% operating margin from Juniper's networking business. Excluding Juniper, operating margin was down 90 basis points sequentially, primarily due to variable compensation and product-related costs.\r\nServer revenue was $4.9 billion, up 16% year-over-year and up 21% sequentially, above the high end of our guidance range. The quarter-over-quarter revenue increase was driven largely by a double-digit increase in AI systems revenue due to a large AI deal we shipped in the quarter, augmented by higher AUP from a favorable mix shift in core compute.\r\nIn traditional server, revenue increased sequentially, driven by volume increases and AUP strength supported by the continued shift to Gen11 servers, augmented by early yet improving sales of our Gen12 servers. In AI systems, we signed $2.1 billion in net new orders driven by robust growth in sovereign net new orders, which increased by triple digits both year-over-year and sequentially, while enterprise net new orders were also up year-over-year. Together, enterprise and sovereign constitute greater than 50% of our cumulative AI orders since Q1 '23. \r\nWe generated $1.6 billion of revenue during the quarter, up 25% year-over-year and up 57% sequentially, driven by the previously disclosed large AI system that we shipped in the quarter. We finished Q3 with our pipeline at multiples of our $3.7 billion ending backlog. Server operating margin of 6.4% was consistent with our outlook. Margin performance improved sequentially, benefiting from the changes we made in pricing and discounting earlier in the year, which returned traditional server product margins to historical levels. This was partially offset by higher AI mix, including a large deal and AI inventory.\r\nMoving to Hybrid Cloud. Revenue was $1.5 billion, up 11% year-over-year, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Sequentially, revenue increased 1%, consistent with our outlook. In storage, our HPE Alletra MP platform continues to drive robust growth, achieving triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter, while high double-digit margins expanded sequentially again.\r\nIn Q3, new logos were up more than 350 sequentially and grew over 70% year-over-year. In Private Cloud, revenue grew strong double digits year-over-year as we see continued growth in our pipeline for PC AI with a number of new enterprise customers doubled quarter-over-quarter. Also, our VM Essential solutions closed over 120 customers in Q3 and has generated a pipeline exceeding 1,000 interested customers since its launch last November. Hybrid Cloud operating margin increased 50 basis points sequentially to 5.9% and increased 70 basis points year-over-year, the fourth consecutive quarter that our OP margin has expanded on a year-over-year basis.\r\nLastly, our Financial Services business generated revenue of $886 million, down 1% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter.  Financing volumes increased 2% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. Our Q3 loss ratio was 0.7%, and return on equity improved sequentially and year-over-year to 17.7%. Operating margin of 9.9% increased 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a higher mix of financing versus operating leases but declined 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter, driven by unfavorable operating expenses despite the higher revenue.\r\nLast quarter, we announced Catalyst a series of initiatives designed to accelerate growth, increase efficiency and make it easier to do business with HPE. Our starting point was an approximate 5% workforce reduction from the exit of Q1 with gross savings of at least $350 million by fiscal year 2027. We are executing well against our plan and expect to achieve our target of 20% of the total savings by fiscal year-end 2025. We are taking an AI-first approach to reimagine our key workflows and have started in my own finance organization leveraging AI to increase productivity.\r\nTurning to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, and free cash flow was a positive $790 million, a significant improvement sequentially as expected. At the end of fiscal Q3, inventory totaled $7.2 billion, down $933 million sequentially. Excluding July ending Juniper inventory of approximately $1 billion, Q3 ending stand-alone HPE inventory was $6.2 billion, down $1.9 billion sequentially. Reducing inventory levels has been a key priority, and we exited Q3 with our balance near our normalized level.\r\nOur Q3 cash conversion cycle was positive 35 days, up 9 days from last quarter. The inclusion of Juniper unfavorably impacted our CCC calculation this quarter as it includes only 1 month of Juniper's revenue and cost of sales results versus the consolidation of Juniper's July ending balances. This timing issue obscures both the progress we made improving our CCC and the positive contributions for working capital the business generated on a sequential basis when excluding Juniper. We expect our CCC will improve in Q4 with a full quarter's consolidation of Juniper's financials as we expect the amount of free cash flow we generate to increase sequentially, consistent with typical seasonality.\r\nWe returned $171 million to shareholders through dividends but were unable to repurchase shares during the quarter because we were in possession of material nonpublic information that we have since disclosed. As we prioritize debt reduction, we remain committed to our dividend policy and expect quarterly share repurchases comparable to levels reported in the first half of fiscal '25, partially offsetting share dilution resulting from stock-based compensation.\r\nAt quarter end and including incremental debt associated with the transaction, our pro forma combined net leverage ratio was 3.1x. We remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating and intend to reduce our net leverage ratio back to our target in the 2x range by the end of fiscal 2027.\r\nNow let's turn to guidance. We are revising our FY '25 outlook to incorporate 4 months of contributions from Juniper Networks. For revenue, we expect constant currency growth of 14% to 16% and estimate currency impacts of 30 basis points, up nominally versus last quarter's estimate. With the inclusion of Juniper, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin outlook for Q4 to be in the mid-30% range and fiscal 2025 to be above 30%. We expect operating expense to increase sequentially, driven by a full quarter inclusion of Juniper. We expect full year non-GAAP operating margin to be in the upper 9% range at the midpoint, benefiting from a sequential improvement in Q4 to the upper 11% range, driven by the continued improvement in Server margins and the accretive contributions from Juniper. \r\nWe are revising our FY '25 GAAP EPS range to $0.42 to $0.46, which includes the impact of Juniper. We are raising our non-GAAP EPS range to $1.88 to $1.92, which reflects accretive contributions from Juniper, though minimal for the year. We are reaffirming our estimate of a $0.02 impact from tariffs in the second half of the year. \r\nLastly, we are revising our free cash flow outlook to approximately $700 million. Excluding Juniper, we expect to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow in line with the guidance we provided last quarter. Through the end of Q3, year-to-date free cash flow was a $934 million use of cash. We expect Q4 free cash flow to be up materially quarter-over-quarter due to better net earnings in addition to favorable working capital driven by significant improvements in accounts receivable collections.\r\nFor Q4, we expect revenue to be between $9.7 billion and $10.1 billion. For Networking, we expect revenue will be up over 60% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting a full quarter of Juniper. We expect our Networking operating margin in Q4 and fiscal 2025 to be in the low 20% range. For Hybrid Cloud, we expect revenue to be roughly flat quarter-over-quarter with a sequentially improved operating margin in the mid- to high single digits. For Server, we forecast a mid- to high single-digit decline in revenue quarter-over-quarter, driven by a greater than 30% sequential decline in AI systems revenue following the large deal that shipped in Q3. We expect Server operating margin to improve sequentially to around 10% for the quarter, reflecting continued momentum behind our improved execution and an improved mix towards enterprise and sovereign as we continue to focus on profitable growth. Going forward, we will remain focused on profitable growth in the Server segment, and we'll continue to assess the optimal balance between volume growth and margins.\r\nWe expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be between $0.50 and $0.54 and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be between $0.56 and $0.60. Our Q4 EPS outlook reflects a sequential increase in diluted shares outstanding to 1.44 billion attributable to the conversion of Juniper-related stock-based compensation shares and forward awards. \r\nFollowing the acquisition of Juniper, we now expect Q4 OI&E in the $180 million to $200 million range. We expect Q4 free cash flow to be up sequentially, reflecting typical seasonality, favorable working capital and increased net earnings.\r\nWith that, I look forward to seeing you at SAM in October. And now let me open the floor for questions.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\n[Operator Instructions] And your first question today will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\n\n## Aaron Rakers (Analysts)\nCongrats on the close of the Juniper acquisition. I guess I want to just dive a little bit deeper into the server margin profile that you guys see. I think, Antonio, in your prepared comments, you said that we've returned to more of a normalized operating margin on the traditional server line. I guess if I look back, I would assume that's kind of in that low double digit, let's call it, 11% to 13% range. I guess if I'm to do that math, it leaves me to question the profitability of the AI server business. And so I guess as you think about that 10%, maybe you can unpack the drivers of getting to that level. And how should we think about that AI server margin profile?\n\n## Antonio Neri (Executives)\nThank you, Aaron, for the question. First, we are very pleased with the progression we made between Q1 to Q2 to Q3 based on the challenges we experienced in Q1 with price and discounting. And as you said, we resolved those issues and the traditional server is back to historical levels around that 10% to 12%, as you talked about it. And so we believe that's consistent with what we see going forward. \r\nRemember, there is a mix shift in addition to those pricing and discount changes to Gen11 and Gen12. The structure of those products is different than Gen10 or Gen10.5, obviously has higher AUP, different attach rates and the like. And that's going to be a core foundation as we enter Q4 for delivering at the total server segment the -- around 10% for the quarter.\r\nNow this quarter, obviously, the mix of AI and in particular, one deal and the work we did on inventory had a short-term impact that ultimately took that, what I call the overall server margin, down to the 6.4%. But as we exit that, which already recognized, then you're going to get a natural lift into that higher single digit to close to 10%. And then, therefore also, you have also the mix of sovereign and enterprise in the AI revenue conversion because as we move from more a server-provider-centric revenue conversion to more a sovereign and enterprise revenue conversion in AI, obviously, we're going to convert less in aggregate numbers, but it's going to have a different margin profile. And that's why Marie and I and the team are very confident that, in Q4, the total server operating margin will be around 10%. So that's the walk, Aaron.\n\n## Marie Myers (Executives)\nAnd I'd just add, Aaron, we also have a robust internal framework that guides us in how we evaluate these AI-related deals and prioritize them as well.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nYour next question today will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\n\n## Wamsi Mohan (Analysts)\nNow that Juniper is closed, can you maybe just talk about some of the early progress on integration and go-to-market changes that we should expect? And any top line synergies and early customer feedback? And Marie, maybe if you could talk about just the longer-term opportunity for HPE in AI, or Antonio. Just relative to networking versus servers, where do you see the larger opportunity for AI both from a revenue TAM and from a margin or profitability standpoint?\n\n## Antonio Neri (Executives)\nThank you, Wamsi. So first, we are incredibly pleased. We closed the transaction of Juniper. I think it was closed at to the right time because, obviously, market recovery is taking place, but also, we see demand across multiple subsegments of the networking market. And as we commented during my remarks and Marie's remark, every subsegment networking had a very strong performance, whether it was HPE Intelligent Edge standalone or Juniper standalone and obviously, on a combined basis is even very, very strong.\r\nBut if you look at campus and branch, both companies are doing very well. Both companies grow in double digits, so that's very strong. In data center switching, and we talked about this during the July 9 call, Juniper had a record break in performance in data center switches and also a very good performance in routing, which we call it the automated WAN. Security was also up in the single-digit year-over-year revenue growth driven by SASE. And then the progress we have made is that -- is very strong, meaning integration is progressing really well. \r\nWe have a series of milestones, which we call it the employee day 1, which is onboarding the employees into our systems. That's a combination of benefits and other things that have to take place. And then we have the harmonization of the sales force, which we call it sales day 1, and that takes place at the end of this calendar year. And we already are incentivizing both sales forces to sell both products. And I can tell you the channel community is super excited to be able to sell both products because the combination of both products allows them to cover every vertical, every use case in every geography. And the fact of the matter is that the complementary 2 portfolio allows us to drive strong security integration in our stack in addition to the integration with the rest of the portfolio with server and storage.\r\nSo we will be able to talk more about this, Wamsi, at the Securities Analyst Meeting. Rami will take center stage and walk through the strategy, early views of the product road map, how we are driving the sales force integration including our channel ecosystem. And we believe that's going to be an opportunity as we enter 2026 and then obviously, '27, '28.\r\nYour question about AI. As I think about the AI space, I always ground myself on 3 very distinct customer segments. In the service provider segment and model builders, our strategy is to lead with networking for AI. The opportunity is significant. Juniper is getting traction, is becoming the de facto standard in many of those customers, and the opportunity with HPE is to expand that footprint. And then we will sell the server products in that unique segment where it makes sense from an accretion from a margin perspective and working capital perspective.\r\nIf you go to the sovereign space, which we saw this quarter a 200-plus percent growth on a year-over-year basis and that sovereign also includes neoclouds, we will lead with an integrated rack scale architecture, meaning Networking plus the Server business and all the services that comes with it. And that will allow us to cover multiple type of offerings as customers in that segment may have the need to drive optionality and flexibility, and we have unique conversations with our partners.\r\nAnd then in the enterprise space, through the AI factory engagement with our private cloud AI portfolio, which this quarter added 300-plus new logos, double from last quarter, we will lead with a fully integrated stack. And that's what we did with NVIDIA. The integration of their software with our GreenLake plus the integrated infrastructure with our HPE ProLiant and Cray for the GPUs and then our Alletra MP storage or fast object and file plus all the services around it to life cycle manage that solution.\r\nSo I think at a portfolio level, we can service every segment, find the right balance, but I think [ networking us ] make us now stronger in the AI space because one of the key elements of that IT stack is the network at scale. Juniper brings amazing technology both at the data center switching and the routing piece because once you integrate this in a large AI deployment, you need to core aggregate all of this through the leaf and spine into the data center footprint, and that requires also a routing product. So more to come at SAM.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nYour next question today will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\n\n## Samik Chatterjee (Analysts)\nAntonio, you talked about -- just following up here on the Juniper sort of line of topics. Your Networking overall margins are taking a bit of a step down to the sort of low 20% range, where the segment historically has been about mid-20s. How should we think about with the synergy road map that you have when the segment gets back to that sort of mid-20s level? Because some of the back-of-the-envelope math on the synergies would suggest you could actually probably go north of that as well long term. But maybe just lay out the road map for us in terms of how to think about the progress on the margin front from the new sort of level that you have post consolidation of Juniper.\r\nAnd Marie, if I can quickly squeeze in one on cash, get the headwinds in terms of closing Juniper on the cash flow this year. But how should we think about sort of the impact on next year's cash flow in relation to any closing costs or integration costs?\n\n## Antonio Neri (Executives)\nSo I will pass it to Marie because I think she will be able to answer both questions so simply.\n\n## Marie Myers (Executives)\nYes, no worries. And thanks, Antonio. So just to preface my answer before I get started, so I'm going to answer both questions in the context of our Q4 and full year '25 guide. We will provide longer-term update to your questions, particularly around cash as we get into Security Analyst Meeting in early October. So let me unpack first of all the networking margin rate. So in the quarter, as you recall, we integrated a month of Juniper's results and our Intelligent Edge business. We combine them now into 1 segment called the Networking segment, and the combined operating margins were 20.8%. \r\nIf you look -- I think your question was focused specifically on the edge business. Our edge margin, actually, I disclosed in my prepared remarks, was 22.7%. And we did see a sequential reduction, and that was really due to 2 primary factors. One is variable comp expense, and the other one is product-related costs. And I did guide the Q4 op range to the low 20s as we get into the quarter. And the reason for that, Samik, is obviously, Juniper's rate was a few points below our Intelligent Edge business. So just bear that in mind as you think forward to the Networking margin rates.\r\nNow with respect to your question on cash flow, we're confident in our guidance for the year. And I would just say, as you think about cash, the puts and takes, obviously, you brought up Juniper costs, and we will give more clarity on that as we get through to SAM. But even as we get into Q4, there's obviously costs that I believe I commented on in Q3 and Q4 and also the increase in OI&E., so all of that taken into account when you think about cash flow.\r\nAnd I'd just add, look, we are absolutely focused on free cash flow. We'll give you a lot more detail as we head to Security Analyst. As you know, our leverage has gone up, and so free cash flow generation is paramount for us.\n\n## Antonio Neri (Executives)\nYes. I want to enforce the last point. Because of the integration of Juniper and the ability to generate earnings, but also pay down the debt, our main focus going forward in addition to drive the right balance of growth and operating margins is really free cash flow generation. And so we will be able to talk more about this at SAM.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd your next question today will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\n\n## Amit Daryanani (Analysts)\nYes. I guess, Antonio, I wanted to sort of go back to the Networking discussion. It sounds like both Intelligent Edge and also Juniper are doing fairly well from a revenue basis. I guess, simplistically, how do you think about the growth rate for the combined business as we go forward? If you think the networking market grows 5%, 6% a year, how do you think HPE plus Juniper can do? And then really, over time, how do you think about product integration on the campus side between Aruba and Mist? Do you think we need to Mistify Aruba or -- and have a single product? Or do you think you can have both the products in the marketplace simultaneously?\n\n## Antonio Neri (Executives)\nYes. Thanks, Amit. Rami and I and the team are very pleased with the momentum both businesses have in the market. That's a reflection that both offers are very strong. And let's remind ourselves that that's true for campus and branch. But when you go to data center switching and obviously, the WAN business, that's 100% Juniper. And then in the security space, we have a robust security portfolio because we need to lead with a secure network approach, and that's inclusive of Juniper firewalls and the secure access service edge or SSE, which both companies have very strong offerings. And as you recall, in 2020, we acquired Silver Peak to drive the convergence between SD-WAN and security.\r\nBut as I think going forward, our goal is to build the best networking business, and that means we're going to grow above market. And that's the reality, and we're going to explain how that's going to be the case over the next 3 years. And we have an opportunity across AI and cloud and across the infrastructure itself. And when I think about the campus and branch question, we were very clear with Rami. We're going to thoughtfully integrate the Juniper platform and the Aruba central platform because you need to think about DAL layer. Everything below that is very straightforward.\r\nThere is no confusion because the reality is that we have a very strong robust campus switching portfolio, which obviously has -- a lot of that has the wired piece, which is Aruba silicon than Wi-Fi access points. I don't think that's too complicated, and we're going to show what that looks like. And then finally, is the extension into IoT private 5G, which obviously HPE has unique offers. But that integration of the cloud and AIOps is where that experience will evolve.\r\nBut we are not going to leave any customers behind. We're going to sell both products, and you're going to see an integration that suddenly happen over time through the AIOps layer. And that's the opportunity we have here. And the good news, customers want both today, and we can serve every market vertical. And we can also deploy any type of solution, whether it's cloud-based, virtual private cloud, meaning sovereign and then on-prem. And that's the opportunity we have ahead of us.\r\nAnd then last but not least, on the data center switching side, in addition to networking for AI, we are also working integration in the private cloud portfolio with the software-defined networking components that Juniper brings through Fidelma's hybrid CloudOps suite. And then obviously, in our storage and Server business, which required a switch along the way.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd your next question today will come from David Vogt with UBS.\n\n## David Vogt (Analysts)\nSo Antonio, I want to go back to the networking piece, and maybe Marie can chime in on this. I think you talked about the traction that Juniper is getting with some of these AI model builders and sort of that part of the network. How much of sort of the opportunity to grow is predicated on Juniper's traction with those customers? And then maybe along those lines, I think Marie mentioned some product-related costs. Was that mix in the networking section do more AI-centric offerings? And how do we think about that mix shift going forward from a more enterprise campus-centric model to one more -- hopefully, one more towards an AI model building sort of cloud model going forward?\n\n## Antonio Neri (Executives)\nYes. Thank you. No, the AI opportunity is across all the 3 segments I mentioned earlier, right, in Networking, which is the service provider where we have the vision to lead with networking there because there is unique value proposition, performance, cost, simplicity, life cycle management and AI-driven capabilities. When you go to the sovereign space, same thesis. And that's even more important because you now drive rack scale integration with the rest of the Server business. And then at the enterprise layer, of course, we want to integrate the Juniper switch in everything we do in cloud and AI going forward by giving customers choice and flexibility. So the opportunity for networking in AI is across all 3 segments. \r\nNow in the service provider space, obviously, once you lay down the simple analogy you make, you lay the pipes inside the data center and you connect the data center to the rest of the interconnect process, then obviously, you become the standard. And then from that solution, you kind of hang this amount of GPUs that comes with those deployments. And so this is why the opportunity is significant, and the benefit for Juniper, which already had good traction, is access to a very -- a larger number of customers that we're not able to access before because we are strategic in many geos.\r\nRemember, we cover 172 countries and also our heritage in countries and geographies where our mix is shifted to those geos, example, Europe and Asia versus North America. So there is an opportunity here as we integrate the sales force but also integrate the architectures.\n\n## Marie Myers (Executives)\nAnd then, David, just to add on to your question around the product costs, that was actually in the Intelligent Edge business that I mentioned that was on a sequential basis, and it was related to a platform transition. Thank you.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nYour next question today will come from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\n\n## Erik Woodring (Analysts)\nAntonio, I was wondering if you could maybe just take a step back and share some details on what you're hearing from customers, what you're seeing in the pipeline as it relates to kind of end market growth for your 3 core end markets, networking, server and storage. And really, what I'm trying to understand is there are some maybe concerns that the markets could be rolling over. There's obviously a lot of aged infrastructure that can be refreshed. What are you hearing from your customers about prioritizing those types of upgrades? And from the HPE perspective, if we put networking to the side because you've talked ad nauseam there, just where do you see the biggest opportunity to take share with the core HPE portfolio in those respective end markets?\n\n## Antonio Neri (Executives)\nWell, thank you, Erik and welcome. I know you are starting the coverage of our company just a few weeks ago, so we appreciate you spending time with us. My view is that the market is robust. We saw that throughout the Q3 quarter. Linearity was very consistent. There was nothing unnatural despite sometimes the Trump tariffs, tariffs, but Marie commented on that, that the net impact of that is very minimal for us at this point in time.\r\nAnd I will say, on the server side, let's start with that, on the traditional server side. There is a refresh going on. We saw double digits year-over-year revenue growth in traditional servers. Customers are refreshing aged infrastructure with more richly configured servers because they can reduce space and cooling on an aggregate basis. So with our introduction on Gen12 servers, we demonstrated we can replace 7 Gen11 servers and 14 Gen10 servers by -- and at the same time, reducing the power consumption by 65% in addition to increase the security in their infrastructure because now we support our own internal iLO 7, which is basically the quantum-proof encryption. \r\nAnd so that's an example of what we see, and that was consistent across all 3 geos. Now there, we participate with discipline, and ultimately, it's a question of volume and margins, which we demonstrated in Q3 that we can do after the challenge we had in Q1. So that's one example. And we believe -- over time, we believe we are poised to potentially gain share in enterprise.\r\nIn the hybrid cloud space, huge opportunity through the transition of the virtualization layer, one of the areas people are focused on AI, obviously, for good reasons. But I can tell you, one of the most exciting areas we see is the ability for customers to update or change their virtualization layer because of the rising costs they have seen in the last, call it, 2 years. We have an enormous amount of proof of concepts going on with our Morpheus and VM Essentials.\r\nWhere we really focus there is the conversion from POCs to revenue. This quarter, we had double-digit growth in our entire software portfolio, which includes OpsRamp, which provides deep observability inside the data center and outside the data center and a multicloud and multivendor so that they can use our AI copilot capabilities that we built inside GreenLake to reduce OpEx.  So they can reduce OpEx on licenses and can reduce OpEx on running that infrastructure in a way it is observed. So that's another example of growth that we expect.\r\nPrivate Cloud is another area we expect to grow. And then Storage on our transition to our IP portfolio, this was the third consecutive quarter of triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth in Alletra MP. Why that's happening is because we architected a new platform. That's totally disaggregated. That provides the most effective block solution for those structural databases while, at the same time, leverage the same infrastructure and grow that in a scale out architecture into the unstructured data for fast object, which is necessary for training or fine-tuning rack models, especially if you do that on-prem and then eventually to do file ingestion. That value proposition is resonating with customers. That's why we gained 1 point of share in the last report from IDC.\r\nAnd then in networking, you're right, we spoke ad nauseam but I do believe there is a transition anyway in the wired switching. Remember, we grew triple digits in Wi-Fi 7. And when you go to Wi-Fi 7, also you need more power at the port level to support those access points. And I believe that's going to be also another opportunity for us.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nAnd your final question today will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.\n\n## Simon Leopold (Analysts)\nI wanted to see if you could revisit the topic of Juniper's position in AI. On the call you hosted in July, Rami had indicated that Juniper had landed some deals in the back end. I'm wondering if you could unpack and give us a little bit more detail on that particular part of the business.\n\n## Antonio Neri (Executives)\nYes, Simon, I think Rami and team had done a great job in landing several customers to become the reference in the networking space above the deployment of NVIDIA Spectrum-X, right? So obviously, inside the rack, it has Spectrum-X all the way down to the NVLink with the NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs and the Grace Hopper GPUs.\r\nBut above that, we have become the standard in some of these very large deployments, and we are in a number of conversations with neoclouds and other service providers where we want to become the standard in that space. And that's why we believe there is a big opportunity in leading with networking for AI in that particular couple of segments. And so that's our strategy going forward. And then obviously, that will make our servers more attractive because also we will have more integration of the rack scale for the sovereign space.\r\nAnd Juniper, when the transaction closed, had a very nice backlog that they built prior to the acquisition, and we expect to unwind that backlog and new orders as we go forward. And so Rami will be able to explain more about this as we go to the Security Analyst Meeting from a pure architecture perspective and how we are approaching that from a sales perspective. So thank you. \r\nYes. Sorry, we're running out of time, but we appreciate your time today. I hope you take away that we are executing with precision, that we have a clear vision for the company. I am and the management team is very excited about the next chapter of HPE after the closing of the Juniper transaction. You see the results of Juniper in our numbers with just 1 month, and we are excited to share more about this when we get at the Security Analyst Meeting in New York, which I know everybody is wanting to get framework for '26, '27, '28. But beyond that, I'm excited to share our vision and the strategy for the company with this amazing portfolio we've built. So thank you very much for your time.\n\n## Operator (Operator)\nConference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.\n",
